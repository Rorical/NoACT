This passage notes the relationship between hunting and the development of Imaginative art during the Paleolithic era.</p><p>Behind the fine craftsmanship and expressive art that characterized the last phases of Paleolithic culture was the mode of life brought about by specialization in hunting big game. In this pursuit a more cooperative 5 strategy, requiring larger numbers of trackers, beaters, and killers, was required; and that presupposes a tribal or clan organization. Single family groups of less than fifty people, only a minority being adult males, could hardly have done the job. That Ice Age hunting life was 10 necessarily dependent upon the movement of the great herds in search of fresh grazing or browsing grounds: yet it developed fixed points of reference and return....</p><p>If curiosity, cunning, adaptability, inurement to repetition were\u2014along with sociability\u2014the prime virtues of early man, the later Paleolithic hunter needed still other traits: courage, imagination, adroitness, readiness to face the unexpected. At a critical moment in the hunt, when an enraged buffalo, already wounded, turned upon the hunters closing in upon him, the ability to act in concert at the command of the most expe\u001frienced and daring hunter was the price of avoiding injury and sudden death. There was no parallel to this situation in food-gathering, nor yet in the later modes of Neolithic agriculture....</p><p>Unlike food-gathering, be it noted, hunting carried with it an insidious danger to man's tenderer, parental, life-fostering nature: the necessity to kill as a recurrent occupation. The stone-pointed javelin or arrow, with its capacity to strike home at a distance as well as at close quarters, enlarged the range of killing and appears at first to have awakened anxious misgivings as to its effects. Even toward the cave-bears he expelled from their shelters and ate for food, Paleolithic man seems to have nourished a sacred fear, as with his later totemic animals. The skulls of these animals have been found arranged as if they were the objects of a cult. Like some hunting tribes to this day, Paleolithic hunters possibly begged the slain creatures' forgiveness, pleading hunger as justification, and limiting the kill to such food as was actually needed....</p><p>The systematic killing of big game probably had still another effect upon Paleolithic man: he was con\u001ffronted by the fact of death, not at infrequent intervals, but as an everyday accompaniment to life. To the extent that he may have identified himself with his victim, he was forced to take into consciousness his own death, too, and that of his family, his kinsmen, his fellow tribesmen.</p><p>Here, under the further incitements of dream, may lie the beginnings of man's devious efforts to prolong his life in the imagination, by assuming that the dead, though physically removed from the scene, are still in some sense alive, watching, intervening, prompting: <span>sometimes benignly, as a source of wisdom and comfort; but in no small number of instances the spirits of the departed, haunting the dream life, are full of malice and must be exorcised, or propitiated, lest they bring on disaster. Perhaps the memorial arts of sculpture and painting, which flourished now for the first time, were deliberate attempts to outwit death. Life departs, but the image remains and continues to enhance other lives.</span></p><p></p><p>The greater part of Paleolithic art was preserved in caves; and in the case of some of the painted images and <span>sculpture found there\u2014about ten percent of the total number\u2014we have reason to associate the art with magic rituals to invoke success in hunting. ...

This passage explains how women from the Heian Period helped to shape Japanese literature.</p><p>Poetry begins in life and its necessities, but in order to flourish as a written art it requires leisure, the time to pursue and to perfect. The Heian Period (794-1185 A D.) in Japan provided an abundance of that leisure and the desire to perfect a tradition which is unique in the histories of world literature.</p><p>The word<span> </span><i>Heian</i> itself means \"peace,\" \"tran\u001fquillity.\" Culture\u2014visual arts, literature, philosophy, music<font>\u4e00</font>was concentrated in Kyoto, where an elegant court gathered around the Emperor and his family. Outside of the capital there was little of interest to these perhaps two thousand people; enormous energy was concentrated injusta few square miles, an energy which could be devoted entirely to clothing, poetry, food, incense and intrigue. There were no wars, no invasions from outside this insulated and insular country, no popular uprisings to distract attention from the refine\u001fment of the senses....</p><p>...Japanese was, during the entire Heian era, considered unsuited to the lofty thoughts of serious poetry, for which the Chinese language was reserved. Japanese would be used for occasional poems, love verses, the literature of seduction and lament. It was left to women to write in Japanese, in the vernacular, while men reserved the supposedly more difficult Chinese for themselves, unaware that what they were writing was imitation Chinese literature, inferior to the original, and, above all, inferior to what contemporary women were writing in their native tongue. . . . But in time it became apparent that all that once appeared trivial and marginal was in fact the outstanding achievement in Japanese literature, and one of the greatest achieve\u001fments in all of world literature. Women produced the best, the greatest classics in Japanese: not simply<span> </span><i>The</i><span> </span><i>Tale of Genji,</i> Murasaki's<span> </span><i>Diary,</i> the<span> </span><i>Pillow Book of Sei Sho nag on,</i> but the poetry of Ono no Komachi, Ise, Otomo no Sakanoe and others. So important were women to the native literature that when men set their hands to writing poetic diaries, as Ki no Tsurayuki did in the<span> </span><i>Tosa Diary,</i> they often wrote under the persona of a woman.</p><p><span>It is clear then that women occupied a strong position in Japan during the first centuries following the development of literacy, so long as the vernacular remained outside the realm of power and prestige. During these first five hundred years they created the themes, forms and moods which shaped subsequent Japanese literary tradition: the</span><span> </span><i>tanka,</i><span> with its elegiac tone and characteristic imagery; the diary; and the novel.</span></p><p></p><p>Deeply embedded in the poems of [Japanese women] are feelings of regret about the shortness of life, the fickleness of love, and the ravages of age, which imbue them with a brooding melancholy. They rapidly became conventionalized and traditional, a sorrowful lament, perhaps, for the passing of desire as much as for the torment of it. These elegiac feelings, and a dark mysteriousness, are an essential part of the tradition, with special literary terms and meanings; they are no<span> longer confined to women.</span></p><p><span>At the end of the Heian era, when political and military</span><span> </span><span>upheaval destroyed the leisurely culture in Kyoto, men, and martial virtues, took over the ver\u001fnacular as well as official culture. Then poetry became something to occupy the rare moments of rest in a soldier's life, or in the lives of hermits, priests, or courtiers confined to the distant court far from im\u001fportant events.</span></p><p></p><p>The imitation of Chinese poetry became a sec<span>ondary occupation even for men; women surrendered their pre-eminence in the vernacular literature, and finally, as in so many other cultures, nearly vanished from the anthologies. The tradition they had done so much to shape was carried on by men.</span></p><p><span>Not until the beginning of the twentieth century did women reappear as an important force in Japanese literature, despite the existence of one or two significant</span><span> </span><i>haiku</i><span> poets, for example Chiyo, in the Tokugawa period. Some modern women poets, like Yosano Akiko, returned to traditional forms,</span><span> </span><i>haiku</i><span> and</span><span> </span><i>tanka</i><span> (which had fallen into disuse), and made use of traditional imagery, but expanded the range of feeling and ex\u001fperience to include more psychological and emotional complexity. Others, like Shiraishi Kazuko, have absorbed various manifestations of Western culture, from T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and other modern poets to jazz rhythms and cabaret songs.

In fact they are marine animals of the echinoderm phylum, a primitive group that also in\u001fcludes starfish, sea urchins, and two other star-shaped members called the feather-stars and the brittle-stars. Echinoderms are distinct from almost all other animal groups in being radially, rather than bilaterally, sym\u001fmetrical. In other words they know top from bottom but not front from back nor left side from right side: They all share a pentamerous anatomical organization, with most of their features occurring in fives: five axes of symmetry, five sets of each organ, five major arteries, and for those like the starfish and the brittle-stars, five legs. They have a mouth hidden under the belly, and an anus that generally marks the center of their back. The skin of an echinoderm is often described as \"leathery\" or \"rubbery\" but think instead of the texture of im\u001fperfectly cooked tripe. Imbedded in that skin are calcareous plates, in some cases quite small and with no interconnections, constituting a minimal skeleton. Echinoderms have been known to stay in one spot, without moving, for up to two years. They have never heard of eyes.

Moving deliberately, they swallow the rich benthic mixture of sand and muck, strain the organic debris from it in their long simple gut, and pass the sterile sand out behind.
