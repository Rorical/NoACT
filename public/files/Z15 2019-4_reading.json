For most of the 20th century, archaeologists assumed that all Viking ships resembled a vessel excavated in Norway in 1880. Known as the Gokstad ship, for the farm on which it was found, it dated to the year 900. A replica was sailed across the Atlantic, from Norway to Chicago, for the 1893 World's Fair. But a discovery in 1962 forced researchers to abandon the idea that the Vikings had only one kind of ship.</font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font><font>At the bottom of a fjord near the Danish town of Roskilde, archaeologists found remnants of five Viking ships piled one atop the other. Dubbed the Skuldelev ships, for a nearby town, each had had a specialized role. One had been a fishing boat; two were cargo ships, so easy to handle that a crew of eight could move 20-ton loads; and one was a warship that could carry about 30 people. The fifth ship, a raider known as Skuldelev 2, was the biggest.</font></font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font>It was 98 feet long but 12 feet wide. Its keel reached just three feet below the surface, and its masts and sail could be lowered to approach fortifications and settlements with stealth.</font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font><font>Because only 20 percent of the Skuldelev 2 could be recovered, the only way to determine its capabilities for certain was to somehow resurrect and sail it. In 2000, researchers at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde began working with scientists to build an accurate replica. They used thousand-year-old methods and replicas of Viking tools, which meant carving each of the ship\u2019s 90 oak planks with axes, wedges, and hammers. After four years, the eight builders had their replica. They called it Sea Stallion from Glendalough for the Irish village where Vikings used to find oak for their ships. With its narrow beam (width) and shallow draft (the depth a ship extends below the waterline), the Sea Stallion could have navigated nearly any river in Europe. But how would it fare on the open sea?</font></font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font>In the summer of 2006, the Sea Stallion sailed under sunny skies and gentle winds from Roskilde to Norway and back in four weeks a virtual pleasure cruise. A test sail in May 2007 around the Roskilde fjord enjoyed similar conditions. A tougher, six-week test was planned for July 2007, with the crew sailing from Roskilde north to Norway, west to Scotland and south to Dublin. Fully loaded, the ship weighed 24 tons-eight of ship, eight of rock for ballast (the weight used to steady a ship) and eight of crew and gear. In ideal conditions, the Sea Stallion could travel 160 nautical miles a day; it could sprint at 13 knots, or almost 15 miles an hour. (A high-tech America's Cup racer might hit 20 knots.) \u201cIt ranks as one of the fastest warships in history,\" says Anton Englert, an archaeologist at the ship museum.</font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font>The ship set sail for Dublin on July 1, 2007, under dark skies that presaged Northern Europe's coldest and wettest summer in decades. Nighttime temperatures plunged below freezing. Three days into the voyage, two crew members had been treated for hypothermia; weak winds forced the Sea Stallion to take a 24-hour tow across part of the North Sea to stay on schedule.</font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font><font>After the six-week test, archaeologists at the ship museum in Roskilde began analyzing data generated during the voyage. High speeds over long distances pushed the ship to its limits\u2014and challenged some assumptions about how the Skuldelev 2 had been put together. \"The sails are very stable and can take a lot of wind, but problems with the rudder come up again and again, and haven't been solved yet,\" Englert says.</font></font></p><p><font></font></p><p><font>Information from the crew proved as valuable as technical data. Exhausted sailors told researchers that the close quarters made sleeping nearly impossible. Between the rough water, constant rain and their nautical duties, it was all crew members could do to nap for an hour or two during their rest periods. \"That indicates the ship must have had an amphibious behavior\u2014they had to land often just to get some rest,\u201dEnglert says. Crossing the North Sea in a narrow ship like this one would have stretched a Viking crew almost to the breaking point, and crossing the Atlantic would have been inconceivable.

Although solid waste s from all sorts of experiments have been sealed in a land fill, certain liquids, mostly chlorinated solvents like trichloroethane, still taint the water that runs under the site. The ongoing attempt to remove these contaminants occupies an enormous experimental facility that covers four acres and looks like a forest.</p><p><br/>\"I like to brag that I have the biggest lab at Argonne.\" says agronomist Cristina Negri, indicating an expanse of 900 poplars and willows growing in rows. The trees stand about 30 feet high. More important, their roots extend 30 feet down, where they tap the contaminated aquifer and literally pull pollutants out of the ground.</p><p><br/>Under normal circumstances, tree roots prefer to sip water from sources as close as possible to the surface. But these trees don't have that option. They are set into plastic-lined pits that force their roots to tunnel deep for drink. The roots lift the contaminated water into the tree trunks, where transport tissues conduct it on up to the branches and leaves. From there, as droplets transpire through leaf pores, the water evaporates and sunlight breaks down the dissolved solvent molecules, rendering them harmless.</p><p><br/>Before the willows and poplars took over the job of wastewater management, Argonne was using extraction wells to pump contaminated water to a treatment plant. But the static mechanical pumps could not chase after groundwater that continually changed course through the complex terrain. The natural pump of a willow or poplar, on the other hand, is not only self-sustaining but so water-loving that it will snake down or fan out as far as need be to reach moisture.</p><p><br/>Negri's trees each pump as much as 26 gallons of water per day at their summer peak. She measures the daily flow through the trunks by inserting probes that transmit data to solar-powered recorders mounted on tripods nearby.</p><p><br/>In summer, trichloroethane levels generally run high (several thousand parts per billion), but in winter, after the leaves fall, the roots stop pumping and the bare branches bear no sign of contamination. Since the trees don't accumulate any permanent residue of pollution, they can eventually be chopped down and chipped, their remains distributed around other plantings for soil enrichment.</p><p><br/>The technical term for this green, and increasingly prevalent, form of environmental cleanup is phytoremediation. At Argonne it will give way, over the next 20 to 30 years, to ecological restoration, as the pollutants are removed and the worker trees replaced by bur oaks and other hardwoods native to the Great Lakes region.</p><p><br/>A second experimental forest, in Murdock, Nebraska, is helping the U.S. Department of Agriculture address the mess that it made in corn-belt communities during the 1960s, when storage drums full of grain were routinely fumigated with carbon tetrachloride to control pests. The colorless liquid seeped into the ground and continue s even now to foul the local water supply.</p><p><br/>When members of the Argonne team arrived at Murdock in 2004 for an initial assessment, they found trace levels of \"carbon tet\" in the resident vegetation. Their solution, implemented the next year, was to create an instant forest. Most of the 2,000 planted saplings were poplars and willows, the same types that had demonstrated their effectiveness in Illinois.</p><p><br/>By 2007, two years after planting, the exact location of the underground plume of contamination could be mapped from the surface by examining the trees. Even in summer, trees in some areas tested clean while those in others were steadily bringing up carbon tetrachloride. Meanwhile, all the trees seemed to have enjoyed unusually rapid growth thanks to another pollutant in the Murdock soil: nit rate, possibly from fertilizers applied in the surrounding cornfields.</p><p><br/>The compatibility of the forest and the fields conjures another poplar dream of combining remediation with energy production. Negri 's colleagues have looked to the poplars as a possible source of ethanol for biofuel. The trees' need for plentiful water seemed at first to make them a poor choice, since water itself is likely to become scarce. But if the trees can slake their thirst with polluted water, and if they can grow on marginal land ill-suited for crops, then their promise as an alternate energy source grows doubly green.</p>", "question": "40.
