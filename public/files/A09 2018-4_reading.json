The fact is that you want to go see someone in the flower trade. His is the hour at which you must rise.

It's known around the world as a remarkably high-tech, high-speed way to sell flowers, but it had modest beginnings: In a cafe outside of Amsterdam in 1911 some growers came up with the idea of holding an auction to give them more control over how their flowers were priced and sold. They called their auction Bloemenlust. It was not long before a competing auction sprang up nearby\u2014the history of flower markets everywhere is that as soon as there is one, there are two\u2014and each day as the auctions ended, flowers were piled onto bicycles and boats to be delivered along Holland's narrow canals and even narrower streets. This arrangement continued until 1968, the two auctions thriving nearly side by side, until they finally merged and became what is known today as Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer, the largest of a hall of major flower auctions going on year-round in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The bus to Aalsmeer took me through the shuttered streets of Amsterdam and headed south, past the airport. The world seemed to be coming to life at last and on the road we passed dozens of trucks\u2014some of them plastered with the same grower and wholesaler logos you 'd see in Miami-carrying flowers to and from the auction. This next phase of a flower\u2019s life,  after it leaves the grower and before it settles into a vase on someone's hall table, is remarkable for both its duration and its complexity. A flower can spend a week making its way through a maze of warehouses, airports, auctions, and wholesale markets, and it will emerge from this exhausting journey looking almost as fresh as the day it was picked.<br/><br/>The existence of this auction highlights one major difference between flowers destined for the European market and those sold in the United States. The flowers that I saw arriving in Miami were headed in every direction at once: they were going by truck, rail, and plane to wholesale markets, distribution centers, bouquet makers, retailers, and even directly to customers here is not a single, centralized market for flowers in the United States. But the flowers that come into Schiphol Airport outside of Amsterdam. The major port of entry for European flowers, are almost all going to Aalsmeer. This is the  very center of the flower trade, handling most of the flowers sold on the European market and some of the goods going to Russia, China, Japan, and even the United States. The flowers going up for auction come from Kenya, Zimbabwe, Israel, Colombia, Ecuador, and European countries, making this a sort of global stopping-off point for most of the industry. Every flower market around the world watches the Dutch auction, which acts as a sort of engine for the trade, setting prices and standards worldwide. If you want to follow a flower to market, you \u2018ll end up here eventually.<br/><br/>By the time the bus pulled into the large circular driveway at the public entrance to the auction, the day really was half over. Flowers and plants had been arriving since midnight, and bidding started before dawn. I stepped off the bus into a kind of floral rush hour: trucks roaring past, people racing from one end of the complex to another, the morning sun glaring down. This lace is a behemoth in the small town of Aalsmeer. It employs ten thousand people a town of just twenty thousand and occupies almost 450 acres, an area larger than Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Epcot theme parks combined.

He read aloud a letter from Senator John Langdon of New Hampshire, the president pro tempore.  \"Suffer me, sir, to indulge the hope that so auspicious a mark of public confidence will meet your approbation and be considered as a sure pledge of the affection and support you are to expect from a free and enlightened people. \" There was something deferential, even slightly servile, in Langdon's tone, as if he feared that Washington might renege on his promise and refuse to take the job. Thus was greatness once again thrust upon George Washington.<br/><br/>Any student of Washington's life might have predicted that he would acknowledge his election in a short, self-effacing speech full of disclaimers. \"While I realize the arduous nature of the task which is conferred on me and feel my inability to perform it, \" he replied to Thomson,\" I wish there may not be reason for regretting the choice. All I can promise is only that which can be accomplished by an honest zeal. \"This sentiment of modesty jibed so perfectly with Washington's private letters that it could not have been feigned: he wondered whether he was fit for the post, so unlike anything he had ever done. The hopes for republican government, he knew, rested in his hands. As commander in chief of the Continental Army, he had been able to wrap himself in a self-protective silence, but the presidency would leave him with no place to hide and expose him to public censure as nothing before.<br/><br/>Because the vote counting had been long delayed, Washington, 57, felt the crush of upcoming public business and decided to set out promptly for New York on April 16, accompanied in his elegant carriage by Thomson and aide David Humphreys. His diary entry conveys a sense of foreboding: \"About ten o'clock. I bade adieu to Mount Vernon, to private life, and to domestic felicity and, with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than I have words to express, set out for New York...with the best dispositions to render service to my country in obedience to its call, but with less hope of answering its expectations. Waving goodbye was Martha Washington, who wouldn't join him until mid-May. She watched her husband of 30 years depart with a mixture of bittersweet sensations, wondering \"when or whether he will ever come home again.\"  She had long doubted the wisdom of this final act in his public life. \"I think it was much too late for him to go into public life again,\" she told her nephew, \"but it was not to be avoided.\"<br/></p>", "question": "20.

New Zealand today is the largest exposed area of a submerged mini continent known as Zealandia that broke off from the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana perhaps 85 million years ago. Thus liberated, Zealandia drifted northeast into the Pacific, carrying plants and animals, including dinosaurs, to its resting spot about halfway between the South Pole and tropics. As Zealandia drifted, it cooled and sank. Shallow seas flooded the land, and a broad continental shelf formed around its perimeter. Despite its isolation from other landmasses, Zealandia did not emerge from the end-Cretaceous extinction unscathed. Many of its marine and terrestrial organisms perished in that die-off. Yet what was bad for those creatures was good for penguins. With marine reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs out of the picture, early penguins could swim the waters around Zealandia free of competition or predation.<br/><br/>Having gotten their sea legs in Zealandia, penguins soon expanded their domain dramatically, dispersing across thousands of miles and into new climate zones. Fossils of Perudyptes devriesi from Peru show that penguins arrived close to the equator about 42 million years ago, settling in one of the hottest places on earth during one of the hottest times in the planets history. By 37 million years ago the birds had spread to almost every major landmass in the Southern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Yet why, after restricting themselves to Zealandia for millions of years, did penguins suddenly start spreading across the Southern Hemisphere. around 50 million years ago? Recently Daniel T Ksepka discovered an important clue to this mystery: a long-overlooked feature on the surface of fossil flipper bones. The humerus bears a series of grooves that are easy to miss among the markings associated with tendons and muscles.<br/><br/>Those grooves form at the spot where a cluster of arteries and veins presses against the humerus. These blood vessels make up a countercurrent heat exchanger called the humeral arterial plexus, which allows penguins to limit heat loss through the flippers and to maintain their core body temperature In coId water. In live penguins not blood leaving the heart gets cooled by the plexus before reaching the flipper tip, and cold blood returning from the flipper gets warmed before approaching the heart.<br/><br/>The identity of the grooves on the fossil flipper bones shed some surprising light on the origin of penguin thermoregulation. One of the most amazing aspects of modern penguin biology is the birds\u2019 ability to tolerate extreme cold. One would logically assume that the plexus evolved as an adaptation to frigid environments. But fossils suggest otherwise. Penguins such as the <i>Delphinornis</i> from Antarctica show that this feature evolved at least 49 million years ago.

Thus liberated, Zealandia drifted northeast into the Pacific, carrying plants and animals, including dinosaurs, to its resting spot about halfway between the South Pole and tropics. As Zealandia drifted, it cooled and sank. Shallow seas flooded the land, and a broad continental shelf formed around its perimeter. Despite its isolation from other landmasses, Zealandia did not emerge from the end-Cretaceous extinction unscathed. Many of its marine and terrestrial organisms perished in that die-off. Yet what was bad for those creatures was good for penguins. With marine reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs out of the picture, early penguins could swim the waters around Zealandia free of competition or predation.<br/><br/>Having gotten their sea legs in Zealandia, penguins soon expanded their domain dramatically, dispersing across thousands of miles and into new climate zones. Fossils of <i>Perudyptes devriesi</i> from Peru show that penguins arrived close to the equator about 42 million years ago, settling in one of the hottest places on earth during one of the hottest times in the planets history. By 37 million years ago the birds had spread to almost every major landmass in the Southern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Yet why, after restricting themselves to Zealandia for millions of years, did penguins suddenly start spreading across the Southern Hemisphere. around 50 million years ago? Recently Daniel T Ksepka discovered an important clue to this mystery: a long-overlooked feature on the surface of fossil flipper bones. The humerus bears a series of grooves that are easy to miss among the markings associated with tendons and muscles.<br/><br/>Those grooves form at the spot where a cluster of arteries and veins presses against the humerus. These blood vessels make up a countercurrent heat exchanger called the humeral arterial plexus, which allows penguins to limit heat loss through the flippers and to maintain their core body temperature In coId water. In live penguins not blood leaving the heart gets cooled by the plexus before reaching the flipper tip, and cold blood returning from the flipper gets warmed before approaching the heart.<br/><br/>The identity of the grooves on the fossil flipper bones shed some surprising light on the origin of penguin thermoregulation. One of the most amazing aspects of modern penguin biology is the birds\u2019 ability to tolerate extreme cold. One would logically assume that the plexus evolved as an adaptation to frigid environments. But fossils suggest otherwise. Penguins such as the <i>Delphinornis</i> from Antarctica show that this feature evolved at least 49 million years ago. The early <i>Waimanu</i> penguins from Zealandia show no hint of the trait at 58 million years ago, however. The plexus therefore must have evolved in the intervening time, when the earth was far warmer than it is today. Back then Antarctica lacked permanent ice sheets and instead offered a temperate forested environment; Zealandia was even toastier.<br/><br/>What use did early penguins have for a heat-conserving plexus in this greenhouse world? Although sea-surface temperatures were high, early penguins probably foraged in cool upwelling regions, which are rich in nutrients and thus support a bounty of prey, including fish and squid. But because heat is lost more quickly in water than air, a warm-blooded animal such as the penguin risks going into hypothermia even in warm seas if the water is below core body temperature. Reducing heat loss through the flipper would have helped them conserve body heat on long foraging swims in chilly waters.</p><p>The humeral plexus may have also allowed penguins to survive the long open-water journeys by which they initially dispersed from Zealandia to other continents. Only much later would modern penguins co-opt this mechanism to invade the sea ice shelves that formed when the planet cooled.</p>", "question": "40.
