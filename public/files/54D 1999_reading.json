One of the reasons may have been that the pig, unlike ruminant animals\u4e00goats, sheep, cattle, </span><span>reindeer, and camel, for example\u4e00cannot digest straw, </span><span>grass, leaves, or twigs. Pig-rearing, in fact, could not </span><span>be embarked on until humans were prepared to invest </span><span>some of their </span><i>own</i><span> food\u4e00nuts, acorns, meat scraps, </span><span>cooked grain\u2014-in the enterprise.</span></p><p><b class=\"now\">The last major food animal to be domesticated was the cow, not apparently in the heartland areas of the neolithic, but (depending on the outcome of a current archeological controversy) either in Catal Huyuk in Turkey or Nea Nicomedia in Macedonia, at some time between 6100 B.C. and 5800 B.C. The task may have been postponed because of the difficulties involved Though the ancestral type of the domesticated breed died out in the seventeenth century, attempts have been made in Munich and Berlin in the last twenty years to re-create it. If the fiery and agile modern version is anything to go by, neolithic man must have had his hands full with the original... .</b></p><p>Since their hunting days, humans had known that, <span>in addition to meat, the goat provided glossy water</span><span>proof hair, and a skin which made a first-class water </span><span>container; that the sheep supplied wool, and substantial </span><span>quantities of fat, useful not only for cooking but as an </span><span>ingredient in medicinal salves and as tallow for rushlights </span><span>and lamps; that the pig's bristles were as valu</span><span>able as its lard and its skin; that the cow's hide was </span><span>tough and strong, and its dung an excellent fuel for the </span><span>fire. But, almost certainly, it was only after the first of </span><span>these animals had been domesticated that humans </span><span>learned about milk and the numerous ways in which it </span><span>could be used and preserved. This new foodstuff, </span><span>which was to become of the greatest importance to later </span><span>generations, was one of the two unlooked-for benefits </span><span>of domestication. The second was that the goat, sheep </span><span>and ox could be pressed into service as agricultural </span><span>laborers, made to sow seeds, pull the plough, and </span><span>thresh the ripe grain.

It moves </span><span>slowly across the sea bottom in shallow Pacific waters. </span><span>It feeds on live coral. Its common name is the crown-</span><span>of-thorns starfish, reflecting the tangle of long sharp </span><span>protective spines that protrude from the dorsal surface. </span><span>Each spine is tipped with a toxic mucus. Any such two-foot-</span><span>wide bush of poisonous spines is, understandably, </span><span>threatened by few natural enemies....</span></p>\n<p>In droves, in swarms, in startling multitudes, <span>crown-of-thorns starfish are gobbling up the Great </span><span>Barrier Reef. \"There is a possibility,\" one scientist has </span><span>written, \"that we are witnessing the initial phases of </span><span>extinction of madreporarian (reef-building) corals in </span><span>the Pacific.\"</span></p>\n<p>The sudden abundance of <i>A. planci</i> has raised a <span>few interesting questions. First and most controversially: </span><span>Is this plague of starfish really so bad\u2014and so </span><span>unprecedented\u2014as it seems? Expert opinion has been </span><span>divided. Second: Has the plague somehow been caused </span><span>by human actions ? .... Studies to prove or disprove the </span><span>human role are continuing at present. Almost everyone </span><span>agrees that if the starfish plague has been caused by </span><span>humankind, then firm measures should be taken to con</span><span>trol it.</span></p>\n<p>The third question is rather more tricky.... If the <span>plague has </span><i>not</i><span> been caused by humankind\u2014if it has </span><span>been an epochal but naturally triggered catastrophe, </span><span>like a lightning-caused forest fire howling across </span><span>Yellowstone Park\u2014in </span><i>that</i><span> case, should anything be </span><span>done to rescue those glorious coral reefs? Or should we </span><span>let unsentimental nature, and the crown-of-thorns </span><span>starfish, have their way?</span></p>\n<p><i>A. planci</i> has been infamous to marine biologists <span>and scuba divers for more than twenty years, since the </span><span>first public reports of its population explosion at a </span><span>place called Green Island.... Green Island marks the </span><span>approximate center of that long chain of individual </span><span>reefs known collectively as the Great Barrier Reef, the </span><span>largest formation of coral ever seen on Earth...</span></p><p>Coral, like starfish, are animals. They belong to <span>the same phylum as sea anemones, and in adulthood </span><span>make their living as sessile creatures, attached permanently </span><span>to a hard substrate, gathered together in large </span><span>colonies of a particular species, each individual waving </span><span>its tiny tentacles to capture planktonic food from the </span><span>seawater. Their more famous attribute is that they </span><span>secrete stony skeletons of calcium carbonate (lime) to </span><span>support themselves. These lime skeletons\u2014both those </span><span>that still contain living coral and those that stan</span>d derelict\u2014form t<span>he main structural matrix of coral </span><span>reefs. Every reef is built up over a vast mass of compacted </span><span>limestone, but it is a thin layer of live coral that </span><span>keeps the reef forever renewed as a living ecosystem </span><span>That layer is precisely what </span><i>A. planci</i><span> at Green Island </span><span>had begun to devour.</span></p><p>From 1962 to 1964 the starfish population grew <span>inexorably. The various species of stony corals were k</span><span>illed off in large swaths and patches. The starfish </span><span>legions accomplished this at a slow but implacable </span><span>pace, each single starfish destroying roughly a square </span><span>yard of coral per month.... Behind the advancing </span><span>front of starfish, which shuffled along like a herd of </span><span>headless porcupines, were left dead coral skeletons that </span><span>remained ghostly white for a few days or weeks, then </span><span>gradually took on a gangrenous film of algae. The </span><span>algae penetrated the lime skeletons and eventually </span><span>weakened them, until normal wave action reduced the </span><span>whole edifice to rubble. By that time, of course, the </span><span>reef-dwelling fishes and other members of the coral </span><span>community, dependent upon that edifice of lime for </span><span>their cover, were long gone. </span><i>A. planci,</i><span> grown abundant </span><span>beyond proportion, was literally co1lapsing its own </span><span>ecosystem.</span></p>", "question": "40.
