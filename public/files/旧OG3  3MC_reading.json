Benyus (\u00a91997 by Janine M. Benyus).<br/><br/>If anybody\u2019s growing biomass, it\u2019s us. To keep our system from collapsing on itself, industrial ecologists are attempting to build a \u201cno-waste economy\u201d. Instead of a linear production system, which binges on virgin raw materials and spews out unusable waste, they envision a web of closed loops in which a minimum of raw materials comes in the door, and very little waste escapes. The first examples of this no-waste economy are collections of companies clustered in an ecopark and connected in a food chain, with each firm\u2019s waste gong next door to become the other firm\u2019s raw material or fuel.<br/><br/>In Denmark, the town of Kalundborg has the world\u2019s most elaborate prototype of an ecopark. Four companies are co-located , and all of them are linked, dependent on one another for resources or energy. The Asnaesverket Power Company pipes some of its waste steam to power the engines of two companies: the Statoil Refinery and Novo Nordisk (a pharmaceutical plant). Another pipeline delivers the remaining waste steam to heat thirty-five hundred homes in the town, eliminating the need for oil furnaces. The power plant also delivers its cooling water, now toasty warm, to fifty-seven ponds\u2019 worth of fish. The fish revel in the warm water, and the fish farm produces 250 tons of sea trout and turbot each year.<br/><br/>Waste steam from the power company is used by Novo Nordisk to heat the fermentation tanks that produce insulin and enzymes. This process in turn creates 700,000 tons of nitrogen-rich slurry a year, which used to be dumped into the fjord. Now, Novo bequeaths it free to nearby farmers\u2014a pipeline delivers the fertilizer to the growing plants, which are in turn harvested to feed the bacteria in the fermentation tanks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the Statiol Refinery, waste gas that used to go up a smokestack is now purified. Some is used internally as fuel, some is piped to the power company, and the rest goes to Gyproc, the wallboard maker next door. The sulfur squeezed from the gas during purification is loaded onto trucks and sent to Kemira, a company that produces sulfuric acid. The power company also squeezes sulfur from its emissions, but converts most of it to calcium sulfate (industrial gypsum), which it sells to Gyproc for wallboard.<br/><br/>Although Kalundborg is a cozy co-location, industries need not be geographically close to operate in a food web as long as they are connected by a mutual desire to use waste. Already, some companies are designing their processes so that any waste that falls on the production-room floor is valuable and can be used by someone else. In their game of \u201cdesigned offal\u201d, a process with lots of waste, as long as it\u2019s \u201cwanted waste\u201d, may be better than one with a small amount of waste that must be landfilled or burned. As author Daniel Chiras says, more companies are recognizing that \u201ctechnologies that produce by-products society cannot absorb are essentially failed technologies.\u201d<br/><br/>So far, we\u2019ve talked about recycling within a circle of companies. But what happens when a product leaves the manufacturer and passes to the consumer and finally to the trash can? Right now, a product visits one of two fates at the end of its useful life.

Associates, L. P.). The CD-ROMs referred to in this passage are discs that, when inserted into a computer, provided the user with multimedia information on a given subjects.<br/><br/>Shakespeare on CD-ROM is potentially the most important thing to happen to the texts of Shakespeare\u2019s plays since the 18th century, when they were first given the serious scholarly attention reserved for cultural treasures. It is important to understand why the innovations represented by these CDs\u2014the BBC Shakespeare Series\u2019s <i>Romeo and Juliet and Voyager\u2019s Macbeth</i>\u2014are so significant.<br/><br/>What exactly is a printed play by Shakespeare? Where it was once thought that Shakespeare\u2019s plays sprang from his noble brow in definitive and final form, it is now widely recognized that many of them were repeatedly revised. Some of these early alterations were likely made by the theater company to adapt a play to a particular occasion, others by a collaborator, others for the government censors, still others by the printer, but many of the most significant changes seem to bear the mark of Shakespeare himself. For example, there are two striking distinct versions of <i>King Lear</i>, three of <i>Hamlet</i> and two of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The point is not simply that Shakespeare had second or third thoughts but rather that he apparently regarded his plays as open and unfinished; he intended them to be repeatedly performed, and this meant that they would be continually cut, revised or even radically reconceived according to the ideas of the players and the demands of the public. The words were not meant to  remain ton the page. They were destined for the beauty and mutability of the human voice.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, even today most editors silently stitch together the different versions of <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>King Lear</i> in an attempt to present the \u201cfinal\u201d version Shakespeare supposedly meant to leave behind. These printed editions also hide or at least de-emphasize the presentation of the play on stage.<br/><br/>The CD-ROM is a radical departure. The words of the play appear on the screen, synchronized with a complete audio performance.

The images also implied that Mars had once had a thick atmosphere. Our planet is blessed with liquid water on its surface only because it has a thick atmosphere to maintain a high pressure and trap the sun\u2019s heat. So planetary scientists proposed that when Mars formed 4.6 billion years ago, it too had a dowry of a heat-trap-ping atmosphere, composed of  carbon dioxide and water vapor. With warmth, water, and air, they speculated, Mars might once have been a garden world, a paradise among planets.<br/><br/>But, as they also discovered, the garden didn\u2019t last long. None of the streambeds were younger than 3.7 billion years. Something happened to Mars, something that stripped nearly all of its atmosphere, killed its streams, and froze the garden forever.<br/><br/>Researchers have suggested many scenarios for the Martian apocalypse. Some have proposed that the sun gradually whittled away Mars\u2019 atmosphere with its wind of charged particles. Others have hypothesized that the planet itself absorbed most of its atmosphere, turning carbon dioxide into carbonate rocks. For the past seven years, however, Ann Vickery and Jay Melosh, two planetary scientists from the University of Arizona, have been exploring a far more spectacular ending: most of Mars\u2019 atmosphere, they suggest, was blasted away by a succession of asteroids and comets.<br/><br/>\u201cThe basic idea,\u201d Melosh says, \u201cis that an impact doesn\u2019t just open a crater.

How high a vapor plume goes depends on the mass and velocity of the object that crashed into the planet. If it is big enough and fast enough, it can drive its plume straight back up into space. The portion of the atmosphere it plows away is then stripped from the planet forever.<br/><br/>To see if this process could account for Mars\u2019 missing atmosphere, Vickery and Melosh essentially ran a film of the Red Planet in reverse, starting with today\u2019s wispy atmosphere and adding back the air that might have been removed by impacts over the cons. First they derived a mathematical expression relating time to the rates of both impacts and atmosphere loss. Using this expression, they then ran the clock backward to find out how long it would take to \u201cgrow\u201d an ancient, Earth-like atmosphere from Mars\u2019 current tiny one. If their model was right, it would produce the original, early Mars.

Using an impact rate that prevailed 3.7 billion years ago\u2014one impact every 10,000 years\u2014Vickery and Melosh were able to start with a virtually dead planet and grow a thick atmosphere in only 600 or 700 million years.<br/><br/>However, now that an attractive explanation finally exists for how the young paradise of Mars was destroyed, some researchers are questioning whether that paradise ever existed in the first place.
