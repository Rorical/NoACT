We were both in difficult situations\u2014I was a shy, ungainly new-comer at a school where many of the students had been together since, kindergarten, and Becky had a particularly unsympathetic teacher. On coming home from school, she'd immediately go to her room and play rock music while she danced around her room (and sometimes on her bed). She talked to herself, incessantly and loudly. The family accepted all this as something Becky needed to do.</p><p>One day, as Becky carried on her usual \u201cconversations,\u201d with her teacher, with other girls in her class, with a boy who'd made fun of her, I was doing homework in the room next door and realized that I, too, needed release from daily tensions, a way to daydream through the failed encounters and make them come outright. Usually, I lost myself in reading or practicing the flute, but sometimes I listened to music and imagined great careers for myself, great travels, great loves. I didn't have the nerve to stomp around my room and yell, as my sister was doing, but our needs were the same.</p><p>We were both struggling with our otherness, although I suspect I did not know this then. Now thatI'm a writer, it's clear to me. Rejection comes to everyone, of course, but for those who are markedly different from their peers, it is a daily reminder of that difference. To most people, my sister and I didn't seem to have much in common; but I knew from that day on that we were remarkably alike.</p><p>If nothing else, this insight helped me to survive my new school. I knew that getting a C was not the worst thing in the world. And when I got an A, I could put it in perspective. I knew there were other kinds of intelligence that were just as valuable; needs that could not be satisfied in school.</p>", "question": "30.
