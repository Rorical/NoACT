After calculating the \u25b3<i>P</i>value for each trial, they used the best-fit line in Figure 2 to convert each \u25b3<i>P</i> value to a mass of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and then calculated the CaCO<sub>3 </sub><i>content</i> (percent of the total mass that is CaCO<sub>3</sub>) for each substance using the equation below:</p><p><img height=\"52.01\" src=\"https://ame-1253155612.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/0cdf75fa66661d1b9ec902370776d5c8\" width=\"450\"/><br/></p><p>The results are shown in Table 1.<br/></p><p><img height=\"339.93\" src=\"https://ame-1253155612.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/942f07a17601a8508c15d43f8dc6e81e\" width=\"420\"/><br/></p><br/>", "question": "40.  Suppose 1 g of Supplement B were mixed with 1 g of eggshell to form homogeneous Powder X, and then 1 g of Antacid C and 1 g of cement were mixed to form homogeneous Powder Y.  Based on Table 1, if Powders X and Y were each tested as in Experiment 2, which powder would have a higher \u25b3P ?", "choices": {"A": "Powder X, because Powder X would have the higher CaCO3 content.", "B": "Powder X, because Powder X would have the lower CaCO3 content.", "C": "Powder Y, because Powder Y would have the higher CaCO3 content.", "D": "Powder Y, because Powder Y would have the lower CaCO3 content."}, "correct": "A"}]}
