The little square table</span><span> stood exactly in the centre of the kitchen, and was covered </span><span>with a starched linen cloth whose border pattern of </span><span>flowers glistened. Louisa\u00b7 had a damask napkin on her </span><span>tea-tray, where were arranged a cut-glass tumbler full </span><span>of teaspoons, a silver cream-pitcher, a china sugar-</span><span>bowl, and one pink china cup and saucer. Louisa used </span><span>china every day\u2014something which none of her neighbors </span><span>did. They whispered about it among themselves </span><span>Their daily tables were laid with common crockery, </span><span>their sets of best china stayed in the parlor closet, and </span><span>Louisa Ellis was no richer nor better bred than they. </span><span>Still she would use the china. She had for her supper a </span><span>glass dish full of sugared currants, a plate of little </span><span>cakes, and one of light white biscuits. Also a leaf or </span><span>two of lettuce, which she cut up daintily. Louisa was </span><span>very fond of lettuce, which she raised to perfection in </span><span>her little garden. She ate quite heartily, though in a delicate, </span><span>pecking way; it seemed almost surprising that any </span><span>considerable bulk of the food should vanish.</span></p><p>After tea she filled a plate with nicely baked thin <span>corn-cakes, and carried them out into the back-yard.</span></p><p>\"Caesar!\" she called. \"Caesar! Caesar!\"</p><p>There was a little rush, and the clank of a chain, <span>and a large yellow-and-white dog appeared at the door </span><span>of his tiny hut, which was half hidden among the tall </span><span>grasses and flowers. Louisa patted him and gave him </span><span>the corn-cakes. Then she returned to the house and </span><span>washed the tea-things, polishing the china carefully....</span><span>Louisa took off her green gingham apron, disclosing a </span><span>shorter one of pink and white print. She lighted her </span><span>lamp, and sat down again with her sewing.</span></p><p>In about half an hour Joe Dagget came. She heard <span>his heavy step on the walk, and rose and took off her </span><span>pink-and-white apron. Under that was still another\u2014</span><span>white linen with a little cambric edging on the bottom; </span><span>that was Louisa's company apron. She never wore it </span><span>without her calico sewing apron over it unless she had a </span><span>guest. She had barely folded the pink and white one </span><span>with methodical haste and laid it in a table-drawer </span><span>when the door opened and Joe Dagget entered.</span></p><p>He seemed to fill up the whole room. A little <span>yellow canary that had been asleep in his green cage at </span><span>the south window woke up and fluttered wildly, beating </span><span>his little yellow wings against the wires. He always did </span><span>so when Joe Dagget came into the room....</span></p><p>She placed a chair for him, and they sat facing <span>each other, with the table between them. He sat bolt-upright, </span><span>toeing out his heavy feet squarely, glancing </span><span>with a good-humored uneasiness around the room. She </span><span>sat gently erect, folding her slender hands in her white-</span><span>linen lap.</span></p><p>\"Been a pleasant day,\" remarked Dagget.</p><p>\"Real pleasant,\" Louisa assented, softly. \"Have <span>you been haying?\" she asked, after a little while.</span></p><p>\"Yes.... Pretty hot work.\"...</p><p>Presently Dagget began fingering the books on the <span>table. There was a square red autograph album, and a </span><span>Young Lady's Gift-Book which had belonged to </span><span>Louisa's mother. He took them up one after the other </span><span>and opened them; then laid them down again, the album </span><span>on the Gift-Book.</span></p><p>Louisa kept eyeing them with mild uneasiness. <span>Finally she rose and changed the position of the books, </span><span>putting the album underneath. That was the way they </span><span>had been arranged in the first place.</span></p><p>Dagget gave an awkward little laugh. \"Now what <span>difference did it make which book was on top?\" said </span><span>he.</span></p><p>Louisa looked at him with a deprecating smile. \"I <span>always keep them that way,\" murmured she.</span></p><p>\"You do beat everything,\" said Dagget, trying to <span>laugh again. His large face was flushed.</span></p><p>He remained about an hour longer, then rose to <span>take leave. Going out, he stumbled over a rug, and </span><span>trying to recover himself, hit Louisa's work-basket on </span><span>the table, and knocked it on the floor.</span></p><p>He looked at Louisa, then at the rolling spools; he <span>ducked himself awkwardly toward them, but she </span><span>stopped him. \"Never mind,\" said she; \"I'll pick them up </span><span>after you're gone.\"...</span></p><p>Louisa got a dust-pan and brush, and swept Joe <span>Dagget's track carefully.</span></p><p>If he could have known it, it would have increased <span>his perplexity and uneasiness, although it would not </span><span>have disturbed his loyalty in the least....</span></p><p>They were to be married in a month, after a singular <span>courtship which had lasted for a matter of fifteen </span><span>years.

She heard <span>his heavy step on the walk, and rose and took off her </span><span>pink-and-white apron. Under that was still another\u2014</span><span>white linen with a little cambric edging on the bottom; </span><span>that was Louisa's company apron. She never wore it </span><span>without her calico sewing apron over it unless she had a </span><span>guest. She had barely folded the pink and white one </span><span>with methodical haste and laid it in a table-drawer </span><span>when the door opened and Joe Dagget entered.</span></p><p>He seemed to fill up the whole room. A little <span>yellow canary that had been asleep in his green cage at </span><span>the south window woke up and fluttered wildly, beating </span><span>his little yellow wings against the wires. He always did </span><span>so when Joe Dagget came into the room....</span></p><p>She placed a chair for him, and they sat facing <span>each other, with the table between them. He sat bolt-upright, </span><span>toeing out his heavy feet squarely, glancing </span><span>with a good-humored uneasiness around the room. She </span><span>sat gently erect, folding her slender hands in her white-</span><span>linen lap.</span></p><p>\"Been a pleasant day,\" remarked Dagget.</p><p>\"Real pleasant,\" Louisa assented, softly. \"Have <span>you been haying?\" she asked, after a little while.</span></p><p>\"Yes.... Pretty hot work.\"...</p><p>Presently Dagget began fingering the books on the <span>table. There was a square red autograph album, and a </span><span>Young Lady's Gift-Book which had belonged to </span><span>Louisa's mother. He took them up one after the other </span><span>and opened them; then laid them down again, the album </span><span>on the Gift-Book.</span></p><p>Louisa kept eyeing them with mild uneasiness. <span>Finally she rose and changed the position of the books, </span><span>putting the album underneath. That was the way they </span><span>had been arranged in the first place.</span></p><p>Dagget gave an awkward little laugh. \"Now what <span>difference did it make which book was on top?\" said </span><span>he.</span></p><p>Louisa looked at him with a deprecating smile. \"I <span>always keep them that way,\" murmured she.</span></p><p>\"You do beat everything,\" said Dagget, trying to <span>laugh again. His large face was flushed.</span></p><p>He remained about an hour longer, then rose to <span>take leave. Going out, he stumbled over a rug, and </span><span>trying to recover himself, hit Louisa's work-basket on </span><span>the table, and knocked it on the floor.</span></p><p>He looked at Louisa, then at the rolling spools; he <span>ducked himself awkwardly toward them, but she </span><span>stopped him. \"Never mind,\" said she; \"I'll pick them up </span><span>after you're gone.\"...</span></p><p>Louisa got a dust-pan and brush, and swept Joe <span>Dagget's track carefully.</span></p><p>If he could have known it, it would have increased <span>his perplexity and uneasiness, although it would not </span><span>have disturbed his loyalty in the least....</span></p><p>They were to be married in a month, after a singular <span>courtship which had lasted for a matter of fifteen </span><span>years.

Our work ethic has been so twisted and </span><span>mutated that even language reflects that our dearest </span><span>wish for ourselves is to grow, to be </span><i>productive</i><span>, and to </span><i>consume.</i></p><p>This has not always been the case. As social critic <span>Stuart Ewen recently noted, \"Up until the 17th century, </span><span>'consumption' had a negative connotation, essentially </span><span>it's about destruction.\" Later, during the 17th and 18th </span><span>centuries, consumption gained a neutral sense in </span><span>describing the new marketplace economics. By the 20th </span><span>century consumerism and consumption were be</span>ing exalted.</p><p>\"To be a consumer is what we are,\" says Ewen. <span>\"Consumption is the ideal we seek. Unfortunately, it is </span><span>still what it meant before the 17th century. A consumption-</span><span>based economy is an economy driven by waste ... </span><span>and therefore constant buying and disposing of goods </span><span>starts clouding the environment, starts destroying the </span><span>ozone layer, starts filling the waters that sustain us with </span><span>garbage ... making life on earth impossible. Then we </span><span>have to realize that consumption as a way of life has to </span><span>be thrown into question.\"</span></p><p>But when our ancestors prayed and worked for <span>growth and productivity they didn't have material gain </span><span>as their only aim. Growth could also be gained in spiritual, </span><span>educational and other realms. Somehow, somewhere, </span><span>we lost sight of what success means and </span><span>fashioned in its place a glorious, shining future where </span><span>bigger is better, new is good, and old is to be replaced </span><span>as quickly as possible. I don't think our forefathers and </span><span>mothers would be satisfied with our fifty varieties of </span><span>cereal, our traffic jams, our undisposable nuclear waste, </span><span>and our landfills full of disposable diapers. Impressed? </span><span>Yes. Horrified? Maybe. Satisfied? I doubt it. Even </span><span>without knowing of the ecological drawbacks, they </span><span>would probably say we are making pigs of ourselves: </span><span>wasting far more than we use; and using much, much </span><span>more than we need.</span></p>", "question": "20.

Using the original instrument\u2014the </span><span>human voice\u2014aided only by </span><i>shekere</i><span>, tambourine, and </span><span>microphone, the ensemble has built a reputation as the </span><span>world's premier female a cappella ensemble [a group </span><span>that sings without musical instruments accompanying </span><span>it].</span></p>\n<p>In helping birth Sweet Honey, Reagon brought sure knowledge of<span> music's informational and transformative </span><span>power to the task. Her musical mission is rooted </span><span>in the rural southern church pastored by her father. \"For </span><span>the first 11 years, our church had no piano, and I'm still </span><span>an a cappella singer. I grew up singing in the nineteenth-</span><span>century congregational tradition\u2014a style that </span><span>can be traced to Africa.\"</span></p>\n<p>In describing that tradition Reagon says: <span>\"Spontaneity is one of the characteristics that mark </span><span>congregational singing. Singers create as they go along. </span><span>Although a leader introduces the song, there is no </span><span>solo tradition. Once the song is raised, the group joins </span><span>and the creation becomes collaborative. You must be </span><span>open to what will happen to the song and you in </span><span>performance.\"</span></p>\n<p>Reagon's life continues to be informed by the <span>Georgia community into which she was born and her </span><span>early civil rights activism with the Student Nonviolent </span><span>Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She, Rutha Mae </span><span>Harris, Cordell Reagon, and Charles Neblett were </span><span>members of the SNCC Freedom Singers. Appearing at </span><span>hundreds of freedom rallies and mass meetings during </span><span>the early 1960s, they were the movement's singing </span><span>newspaper\u2014reporting and defining the actions and </span><span>issues from the civil rights war zones where they were </span><span>frequently arrested. In many ways her mission has not </span><span>changed.</span></p>\n<p>Spirituality, consciousness-raising, social respon<span>sibility, healing, and\u2014most of all\u2014love resonate at the </span><span>heart of Sweet Honey's repertoire. Songs such as </span><span>\"Patchwork Quilt,\" \"Are My Hands Clean?\" and the </span><span>Grammy-nominated \"Emergency,\" address AIDS, </span><span>worker and environmental exploitation, and racism.</span></p>\n<p>The first song Reagon taught the group was one <span>she'd never sung but remembered from her youth, </span><span>\"Sweet Honey in the Rock.\" \"When I asked my father </span><span>about its meaning, he said it was a parable that referred </span><span>to a land where, when rocks were cracked, honey would </span><span>flow from them.\" Reagon came to interpret this as a </span><span>metaphor for the legacy of African American women in </span><span>the United States. Within many African traditions rocks </span><span>are considered living spirit</span>s. \"So too, sometimes, we, black women, have had to have the standing power of rocks and of mountains\u2014cold and hard, strong and stationary. That quality has often obscured the fact that inside the strength, partnering the sturdiness, we are as honey. If our world is warm, honey flows and so do we. If it is cold, stiff, and stays put\u2014so do we.\"</p><p>Reagon, Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Nitanju Bolade <span>Casel, Shirley Childress Johnson, Aisha Kahlil, and </span><span>Carol Maillard are the women who currently compose </span><span>the musical collective. Over the years\u00b7 more than </span><span>singers have been members of the group.</span></p><p>The group meets, in the ancient way of women, communally. Each is aware of the others' unique contributions. Each serves as a master teacher in at least one repertoire or singing style and apprentices in an area covered by another member. They write, produce, discuss points of view, and develop ideas for songs and treatments.</p><p>The fluid communal spirit of the group is manifest <span>in every performance.</span></p><p>\"People who respond so enthusiastically to Sweet Honey hear their own inner echo. They hear their names called, their thoughts confirmed,\" says Reagon.</p><p>\"After a Sweet Honey performance, people often <span>ask, 'Why do I feel so good after hearing songs that </span><span>deal with issues I usually find paralyzing to think</span><span> about?'</span></p><p>\"Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze <span>you, they're supposed to help you discover who you </span><span>are. They're the prod that moves you forward.</span></p><p>\"The civil rights movement was the most won<span>derful thing I experienced in my life,\" Reagon muses. </span><span>\"Day by day, I found courage to be who I was. Finding </span><span>courage. Taking the risk. There was something about </span><span>doing things that I had always been warned would kill </span><span>or ruin you. Well, I did get suspended and I did go to </span><span>jail\u2014things I had been told to avoid at all costs. But I </span><span>found that if you avoided everything that was a risk, </span><span>there would be many things you'd never know about </span><span>yourself.\"</span></p>", "question": "30.
