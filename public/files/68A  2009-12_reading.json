Their answer is that the business of writing reports\u2014at least at the IMF\u2014is an intensely collaborative process, involving the professional judgments and contributions of many people. The economists bring drafts of report to conference rooms, spread out the relevant pages, and negotiate changes with one another. They go back to their offices and jot down comments in the margin, taking advantage of the freedom offered by the informality of the handwritten note. Then they deliver the annotated draft to the author in person, taking him or her, page by page, through the suggested changes.

According to Sellen and Harper, paper has a unique set of \"affordances\" that is, qualities that permit specific kinds of uses. Paper is tangible: we can pick up a document, flip through it, read little bits here and there, and quickly get a sense of it. Paper is spatially flexible, meaning that we can spread it out and arrange it in the way that suits us best. And it's tailorable: we can easily annotate it, and scribble on it as we read, without altering the original text. Digital documents, of course, have their own affordances.

Paper is tangible: we can pick up a document, flip through it, read little bits here and there, and quickly get a sense of it. Paper is spatially flexible, meaning that we can spread it out and arrange it in the way that suits us best. And it's tailorable: we can easily annotate it, and scribble on it as we read, without altering the original text. Digital documents, of course, have their own affordances. They can be easily searched, shared, stored, accessed remotely, and linked to other relevant material. But they lack the affordances that really <span>matter</span><span> to a group of people working together on a report.</span></p><p><span>Paper enables a certain kind of thinking. What covers many desks are piles of paper\u2014journals, magazines, binders, postcards, videotapes, and all the other artifacts of the knowledge economy. When a group at a leading computer company studied piling behavior several years ago, they found that even the most disorderly piles usually make perfect sense to the piler. Over time, piles get broken down and resorted, sometimes chronologically and thematically; clues about certain documents may be physically embedded in the file by, say, stacking a certain piece of paper at an angle or inserting dividers into the stack.</span></p><p><span>But why do we pile documents instead of filing them? Because piles represent the process of active, ongoing thinking. The psychologist Alison Kidd, whose research Sellen and Harper refer to extensively, argues that \"knowledge workers\" use the physical space of the desktop to hold \"ideas which they cannot yet categorize or even decide how they might use.\" The messy desk is not necessarily a sign of disorganization. It may be a sign of complexity: those who deal with many unresolved ideas </span>simultaneously<span> cannot sort and file the papers on their desks, because they haven't yet sorted and filed the ideas in their head. Kidd writes that many </span><span>of the people she talked to use the papers on their desks as contextual cues to \"recover a complex set of threads without difficulty and delay\" when they come in on a Monday morning, or after their work has been interrupted by a phone call. What we see when we look at the piles on our desks is, in a sense, the contents of our brains.</span></p>", "question": "20.

The rivers flow, the oceans perform their slow and elegant gyrations, the clouds congeal and weep. Each 3,100 years, a volume of water equivalent to all the oceans passes through the atmosphere, carried there by evaporation and removed by precipitation. Yet only a thousandth of 1 percent of the planet's total water resides in the atmosphere at any moment, enough to deposit just one inch of rain if it all fell uniformly throughout the world. This constant overturn of water between the reservoirs on land, in sea, and in sky is called the hydrological cycle, and it is as crucial for life on Earth as is the presence of liquid water in the first place.</p><p>Most of the water that falls as rain has found its way into the sky from the sea surface: the Sun's heat removes from the oceans the equivalent of three feet in depth each year\u2014208 cubic miles in total every day. A further 38 cubic miles evaporates each day from the land surface. Of course, this rate of evaporation varies widely with the seasons and with geographical location: because the tropics are warmer, the rate of evaporation there is at least four times greater than at the poles.</p><p>Evaporation from the ground and from plants (a process called transpiration) removes water to the atmosphere, while precipitation, generally as rain and snow, supplies it to the land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation defines the amount of fresh water available for lakes, streams, and other reserves on land. This \"runoff,\" which is mostly returned to the oceans through rivers, adds up to about 24 cubic miles globally per day.</p><p>The various cogs of the hydrological cycle turn at a wide range of speeds. Rainfall in a river's upland source region can take weeks to reach the sea, while water vapor evaporated from the sea surface typically takes about ten days to fall again as rain. For water locked up as ice (in the so-called cryosphere), the cogs may grind slowly indeed. The water at the base of the polar ice sheets has typically been frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Most mountain glaciers melt and recede by several miles every decade under present-day conditions, while the sea ice in the polar seas expands and retreats seasonally.</p><p>The very existence of a hydrological cycle is a consequence of water's unique ability to exist in more than one physical state\u2014solid, liquid, or gas\u2014under the conditions that prevail at the surface of the planet. Volcanic areas excepted, the Earth's surface never gets hot enough to boil water; but it evaporates readily nonetheless, since the amount of water vapor in the air is generally well below the \"saturation vapor pressure,\" which indicates the maximum humidity of air before <span>water droplets start to condense. That's why the oceans are, to a greater or lesser degree, always \"steaming.\" When moist air cools, the water vapor may condense back to the liquid state, producing the pearly billows of clouds or the dank blankets of mountain mist.</span></p><p>The freezing of water, meanwhile, can send it on a millennia-long detour from the cycle of evaporation and precipitation. Yet the ability of water to enter the solid state is also a crucial aspect of the overall cycle. When water is frozen during the ice ages, the world's seas recede, the climate becomes drier, deserts expand, and ecosystems may be utterly transformed.</p><p>The hydrological cycle emphasizes the dynamic nature of the Earth's environment: it is constantly repeating and renewing itself. Substances other than water are cycled by geological and biological processes too. These cyclic sequences of chemical and biological transformation of the elements are called biogeochemical cycles.</p><p>Water is the lubricant for biogeochemical cycling. Because it is such a superb solvent, and because it is itself in constant flux, it helps to convey other substances hither and thither, between different ecosystems and different climates. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in the surface waters of the sea to provide a carbon source for marine photosynthesis, and in turn this biological growth in the ocean's upper layer drives the rest of the ocean's carbon cycle. Essential nutrients pervade the seas in soluble form: nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, and metals such as iron.
