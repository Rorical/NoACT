Suppose the writer's goal had been to write a brief persuasive essay describing the devastating effects that poor drought management can have on an area's ecosystem. Would this essay accomplish that goal?", "choices": {"A": "Yes, because it effectively uses the example of the dying spruce tree to illustrate the greater devastation to the area.", "B": "Yes, because it criticizes the Santa Fe government's response to the drought for compounding the damage to the surrounding ecosystem.", "C": "No, because it connects the effects on the narrator's yard with climate conditions rather than with drought management practices.", "D": "No, because it fails to connect the area's drought to the death of the blue spruce tree."}, "correct": "C"}]}
