Inspired perhaps by the legendary Admiral Byrd, they had undertaken to build an igloo. Talking, chattering, arguing, working away with their jackets thrown off and woolen caps askew, the friends were cutting blocks of snow with a coal shovel and laying out a circular foundation. <span>Their faces were red and their breaths were spouts of steam. As they slowly built the igloo up on an ever-decreasing circumference, I watched with a sense of the anti-material oppositeness of the thing; bit by bit, it was eliminating itself as an idea from the light of the sun. I felt that what was being built was not a shelter but some structured withdrawal from the beneficence of the lighted day, and my excitement was for invited darkness, the reckless enclosure, as if by perverse and self-destructive will, of a secret possibility of life that would be better untampered with. I jumped up and down in a kind of ecstasy of my own being, inducing deliberately from my frame a series of spasms of shivers of concentrated awareness. Little by little the light was being blacked out, and when the final block of wet snow was installed at the apex of the hemisphere, my brother, who had been working as the inside man, disappeared entirely.</span></p><p><br/>I was very impressed. It was a marvel of an igloo for anyone to have built, let alone five or six arguing. pushing, shouting boys. Donald dug his way carefully out the side and then they all built a crawl-through entrance, a kind of hemicylindrical foyer. Then a hose was brought out to play water over the igloo so that it would freeze up hard. Then they punched an air hole in the top with a length of broomstick and the thing was done.<br/><br/> By the next day the igloo had become the talk of the neighborhood. Not only children but adults came down the alley from the street to have a look at it.<br/><br/>My mother had donated a square of old carpet and a candle and the five builders had settled in, only some times deigning to respond to the importuning of the <span>children outs side who wanted a turn. Actually, they soon grew bored of occupying the thing, learning fast enough that the real excitement had been the building of it; but it was almost as good lording it over their friends and those who were younger, designating this or that one to take a turn, and instructing him as to the rules of deportment once he was admitted. For a while they had considered charging admission, but settled instead for barter offered in bribe\u2014\u2014one child paying with a small American flag on a stick, another a candy bar, another a half-eaten sandwich, and so on. As younger brother of one of the founding architects, I had a special relationship to the igloo, being one of the first guests permitted entrance and, thereafter, more or less free to enter and exit at my own judgment at such moments as the crowd inside was not too great. It was a source of amazement to me how, in this hemisphere of snow, my house, my yard and the Bronx, New York, disappeared in space and time.

You took off your hat and jacket or you were, almost immediately, glisteningly hot as on the hottest day of summer.</span></p><p><br/>The igloo lasted physically long after the builders and everyone else grew bored with it.

But the patients often ad-lib.<br/><br/>\"By the time they get to performance they know the patient so intimately they can answer any question,\" O'Gara said. \"The biggest job for the trainer is anticipating any contingency the patient may encounter.\"<br/><br/>In the feedback sessions after the \"exam,\" patients either fill out a form or give an assessment directly to the student.</p><p><br/>Dr. Swartz said feedback was often missing when medical students practiced with real patients on hospital rounds. In addition, rounds are less instructive than they were in the past because many more people are treated as outpatients, so students may not see a wide variety of diseases.</p><p>The idea of using standardized patients was developed in 1963 by Dr. Howard S Barrows, who was then a neurologist at the University of Southern California.</p><p>\"When I first introduced it, everyone thought it was the craziest thing they'd ever heard of in their lives,\" said Dr. Barrows, 73, a professor emeritus at Southern Illinois University Medical School, who continues to consult and write from his home in Hamilton Ontario. He came up with the idea after noticing the criteria faculty used to evaluate medical students' clinical skills were unscientific at best.<br/><br/>Recalling an experience from his last year of residency, in which a disgruntled patient fooled a doctor by faking symptoms, he realized that he could train people to simulate various physical signs and symptoms. But most doctors, trained in the tradition of teaching students on rounds, objected to pretend patients.</p><p>Because of the \"resistance to it from the start,\" Dr. Barrows said, \"I never envisioned that it would become so generally used around the world.\"</p>", "question": "20.

She says that it is sometimes lonely. I do not tell her how lonely it can be to be one of many, especially if you do not fit in. Instead I tell her that I will be a librarian, a writer, and will never marry. She laughs at me when I say that I will never marry, and tells me of course I will. We have birthdays in the same mouth.

Because the workers in a honey bee colony cooperate with each other, they can efficiently utilize the various sources of pollen and nectar in their territory, synchronizing their efforts to coincide with sources that are constantly shifting in time and space. The plants in a patch will yield pollen and nectar while they are blossoming but will be useless when the blossoms fade. Honey bee colonies are likely to exploit several kinds of pollen and nectar plants at the same time, but if a colony is to survive and prosper, it must constantly find new food sources to replace others that become unproductive.<br/><br/> Honey bees live in large, complex, and highly organized societies, probably the most advanced of the insect societies, and among animals other than insects, exceeded in complexity only by human society. But honey bee and human societies are fundamental different. A human community with a population of 50,000 consists of people and family groups that are usually not related to each other. A honey bee colony may include 50,000 individuals, but it is a huge family unit, all of its members the children of one queen.<br/><br/> A honey bee colony is, for two major reasons, exquisitely prepared to exploit with maximum efficiency the pollen and nectar sources in its territory, which often encompasses as much as 43 square miles. First, the colony constantly sends out workers that scout for new sources of pollen and nectar. Second, when a successful scout returns to the nest, she uses the \"dance language of the bees,\" more precisely the waggle dance, to communicate to her sister workers the exact location of the new resource.

Well described by Thomas Seeley in <i>Honey Bee Ecology</i> and <i>The Wisdom of the Hive</i>, the dance is in the form of a figure eight. The scout begins by making a straight-line run, the crossbar of the eight.

The direction is expressed\u2014\u2014quite accurately\u2014\u2014as a deviation from a straight line from the nest to the sun. Just as we follow the convention that the top of a map represents north, honey bees follow the convention that the top of he comb symbolizes the direction of the sun. Thus when a worker conveys the direction of a food source that is directly opposite the direction of the sun, she directs the waggle run straight downward.

Second, when a successful scout returns to the nest, she uses the \"dance language of the bees,\" more precisely the waggle dance, to communicate to her sister workers the exact location of the new resource. The language of the honey bees is one of the most astonishing marvels of nature. Until Karl von Frisch deciphered the meaning of the waggle dance early in the twentieth century, no one even dreamed that one insect could communicate complex information to another insect.<br/><br/>The waggle dance is performed on the vertical surface of one of the waxen combs that hangs in the dark interior of the nest. Well described by Thomas Seeley in <i>Honey Bee Ecology</i> and <i>The Wisdom of the Hive</i>, the dance is in the form of a figure eight. The scout begins by making a straight-line run, the crossbar of the eight. She then turns to the right and loops back to the beginning of the crossbar and makes another straight-line run along its path. Then she loops to the left and again returns to the beginning of the crossbar. She has now described a figure eight and repeats this pattern time after time, wage ling her abdomen from side to side and emitting a high-pitched squeak as she moves along the crossbar.

The direction is expressed\u2014\u2014quite accurately\u2014\u2014as a deviation from a straight line from the nest to the sun. Just as we follow the convention that the top of a map represents north, honey bees follow the convention that the top of he comb symbolizes the direction of the sun. Thus when a worker conveys the direction of a food source that is directly opposite the direction of the sun, she directs the waggle run straight downward. If its direction is directly toward the sun, her waggle run goes straight up the comb.

Because the workers in a honey bee colony cooperate with each other, they can efficiently utilize the various sources of pollen and nectar in their territory, synchronizing their efforts to coincide with sources that are constantly shifting in time and space. The plants in a patch will yield pollen and nectar while they are blossoming but will be useless when the blossoms fade. Honey bee colonies are likely to exploit several kinds of pollen and nectar plants at the same time, but if a colony is to survive and prosper, it must constantly find new food sources to replace others that become unproductive.<br/><br/>Honey bees live in large, complex, and highly organized societies, probably the most advanced of the insect societies, and among animals other than insects, exceeded in complexity only by human society. But honey bee and human societies are fundamental different. A human community with a population of 50,000 consists of people and family groups that are usually not related to each other. A honey bee colony may include 50,000 individuals, but it is a huge family unit, all of its members the children of one queen.<br/><br/>A honey bee colony is, for two major reasons, exquisitely prepared to exploit with maximum efficiency the pollen and nectar sources in its territory, which often encompasses as much as 43 square miles. First, the colony constantly sends out workers that scout for new sources of pollen and nectar. Second, when a successful scout returns to the nest, she uses the \"dance language of the bees,\" more precisely the waggle dance, to communicate to her sister workers the exact location of the new resource. The language of the honey bees is one of the most astonishing marvels of nature. Until Karl von Frisch deciphered the meaning of the waggle dance early in the twentieth century, no one even dreamed that one insect could communicate complex information to another insect.<br/><br/>The waggle dance is performed on the vertical surface of one of the waxen combs that hangs in the dark interior of the nest. Well described by Thomas Seeley in <i>Honey Bee Ecology</i> and <i>The Wisdom of the Hive</i>, the dance is in the form of a figure eight. The scout begins by making a straight-line run, the crossbar of the eight. She then turns to the right and loops back to the beginning of the crossbar and makes another straight-line run along its path. Then she loops to the left and again returns to the beginning of the crossbar. She has now described a figure eight and repeats this pattern time after time, wage ling her abdomen from side to side and emitting a high-pitched squeak as she moves along the crossbar. As she dances. other workers crowd in close, touch her with their antennae, and follow her through the movements of the dance.</p><p><br/>The straight-line waggle run of the dance conveys two crucial pieces of information, the distance to the new resource and the direction in which it lies. The distance is conveyed by the waggle run's duration\u2014\u2014the longer it takes, the more distant the flowers. The direction is expressed\u2014\u2014quite accurately\u2014\u2014as a deviation from a straight line from the nest to the sun. Just as we follow the <b class=\"now\">convention</b> that the top of a map represents north, honey bees follow the convention that the top of he comb symbolizes the direction of the sun. Thus when a worker conveys the direction of a food source that is directly opposite the direction of the sun, she directs the waggle run straight downward. If its direction is directly toward the sun, her waggle run goes straight up the comb. If the direction is 50 degrees to the left of a straight line from the hive to the sun, the waggle run is directed 50 degrees to the left of the vertical axis of the comb.</p><p>The workers that have allowed the scout's dance then fly to the new patch of blossoms. If they are successful in their quest for pollen and nectar, they return to the hive to repeat the dance and recruit more workers. If the patch of blossoms is not productive, they do not to repeat the dance. As long as the source continues to be productive, more and more workers will forage there and dance to recruit yet more workers. In this way, the foraging activity of the colony is focused on this patch and probably a few other productive patches of blossoming plants.</p>", "question": "40.
