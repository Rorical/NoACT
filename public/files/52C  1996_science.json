This happens over the entire geographic range of the species. The fossil record should show long sequences of intermediate forms leading from earlier to later forms. If no intermediate forms are found, gradualists claim it is due to the incompleteness of the fossil record. Either no rocks were deposited during that period, those that were have been eroded away, or conditions were such that no fossils were formed.</span></p><p><span><i>Episodic Evolution</i><br/></span><span>Some scientists suggest that the changes in life forms are <i>episodic</i> (changing at irregular intervals). New species appear when small subpopulations of the earlier form become isolated in a small area, usually on the margin of the ancestor's <i>geographic range</i> (the region throughout which an organism naturally occurs). Different environmental conditions there cause rapid changes in this isolated population, and, in a few thousand years, a new species may form. In the small area, where the isolated population existed, the record should show sudden of replacement ancestor by descendant, without intermediate forms. Once formed, a new species should not show much change. </span><span>Most evolution is concentrated in episodes that are brief compared to the time period in which the species existed.</span></p>", "question": "40. Foraminifera (single-celled animals with microscopic shells) are thought to evolve primarily by Gradualism. These organisms live in the open ocean, floating on water currents. Why might these organisms be expected to evolve by Gradualism rather than by Episodic Evolution?", "choices": {"A": "Because there are few opportunities for subpopulations to become isolated ", "B": "Because the ocean environment changes rapidly over time", "C": "Because the ocean environment is constantly changing", "D": "Because they are single-celled"}, "correct": "A"}]}
