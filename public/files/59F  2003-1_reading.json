These <span>are sturdy crutches, just the right size. I am delighted </span><span>with them and launch myself around the house on them.</span></p><p>And take a fall immediately. And continue falling <span>several times a day, great splatting, knocking-into-fur</span><span>niture-and-breaking-things falls that cause everyone in </span><span>the family to come running. My grandfather has for</span><span>gotten to put rubber tips on the ends of my crutches. </span><span>When we figure this out and buy the rubber tips and put </span><span>them on the crutches, I stop falling. But by then the </span><span>bone-set that was coming along nicely has slipped, and </span><span>the doctor has ordered me back to the wheelchair.</span></p><p>The missing crutch-tips are the first clue I have to <span>this peculiar family trait, one that for lack of any better </span><span>term I must call \u201cflawed competence.\u201d We Bryants are </span><span>a family of able and clever people, industrious, intelli</span><span>gent, determined, and of good will. We are careful in </span><span>our work. After all, my grandfather measured me on </span><span>two occasions before he made the crutches. But we usu</span><span>ally do something wrong. </span></p><p><span>Four years later I become increasingly aware of </span><span>\u201cflawed competence\u201d when I develop a plan for con</span><span>verting our old grown-over tennis court into a basket</span><span>ball court. My grandfather is always interested in plans, </span><span>and in this planning session, we decide that he will </span><span>make the hoops, and he will help me make the back</span><span>boards. Clearing the ground and smoothing the surface </span><span>will be my tasks. So I rip out honeysuckle and hatchet </span><span>down a few little scrub cedars. We Bryants are known </span><span>for setting our minds to things.</span></p><p>Then my grandfather delivers the hoops. They are <span>beautifully designed and constructed, metalwork of a </span><span>high order for such amateurs as my grandfather and his </span><span>men. But the hoops are twice as big around as ordinary </span><span>basketball hoops.</span></p><p>I say, simply, that they are too big. I am not <span>ungrateful, not trying to be hateful, not in my opinion </span><span>being overly fastidious. I am simply describing a char</span><span>acteristic of the hoops. But my grandfather\u2019s feelings </span><span>are damaged. No, they can\u2019t be made smaller, and no, </span><span>he\u2019s not interested in helping me with the backboards </span><span>now or with any other part of my plan. He\u2019s sorry he </span><span>got involved in the first place. This, too, is a corollary </span><span>of \u201cflawed competence.\u201d We are sensitive, especially </span><span>about our work, especially about the flawed part of our </span><span>work.</span></p><p>At the place where I work twenty-eight years after <span>the basketball hoops, I am given a new office, one with </span><span>a view of the lake. There\u2019s a string attached, though, </span><span>and that is that I have to build my own bookcases. I </span><span>commence planning with enthusiasm. That\u2019s another, </span><span>less harmful family trait, that attraction to making </span><span>plans. I measure, I look at other people\u2019s shelves, I get </span><span>someone to help me attach brackets to my office walls.</span></p><p>It is while I am cutting a notch in one of the <span>uprights to allow access to the light-switch that I sud</span><span>denly think of my grandfather and those basketball </span><span>hoops. I feel a light sweat break out on my forehead. A </span><span>pattern of genetic fate reveals itself to me: I\u2019m going to </span><span>mess up these bookshelves just as my grandfather </span><span>before me would have messed them up. No doubt I\u2019m </span><span>sawing the notch in the wrong place. </span></p><p><span>The whole time I work I wait to see where the </span><span>screw-up is going to come. I imagine what my col</span><span>leagues will be saying about me in the hallways. Did </span><span>you know that Bryant built his shelves so they tilt? Did </span><span>you know that Bryant\u2019s books rejected the color he </span><span>painted his shelves? But the screw-up doesn\u2019t appear. I </span><span>paint the shelves red, and they look O.K. (Granddaddy </span><span>Bryant once painted yellow a whole row of company </span><span>houses he built.) I paint a chair blue and red, and it\u2019s </span><span>a little silly-looking, but it picks up the blue of the </span><span>carpet and the red of the shelves.

This </span><span>other side of development or disease is something I see, </span><span>potentially, in almost every patient; and it is this which </span><span>I am especially concerned to describe.</span></p><p>Similar considerations were brought up by A. R. <span>Luria, who studied the long-term survival of patients </span><span>who had cerebral tumors or had suffered brain injuries </span><span>or strokes\u2014and the ways, the adaptations, they used to </span><span>survive.

Vygotsky). </span><span>Vygotsky stressed the intactness rather than the deficits </span><span>of such children:</span></p><p><b class=\"now\">A handicapped child represents a qualitatively different, unique type of development. . . . If a blind child or a deaf child achieves the same level of development as a normal child, then the child with a defect achieves this <i>in another way, by another </i><i>course, by other means;</i> and, for the pedagogue, it is particularly important to know the uniqueness of the course along which he must lead the child. This uniqueness transforms the minus of a handicap into the plus of compensation.</b></p><p><span>That such radical adaptations could occur demanded, </span><span>Luria thought, a new view of the brain, a sense of it not </span><span>as programmed and static, but rather as dynamic and </span><span>active, a supremely efficient adaptive system geared for </span><span>evolution and change, ceaselessly adapting to the needs </span><span>of the organism\u2014its need, above all, to construct a </span><span>coherent self and world, whatever defects or disorders </span><span>of brain function befell it. That the brain is minutely </span><span>differentiated is clear: there are hundreds of tiny areas </span><span>crucial for every aspect of perception and behavior. The </span><span>miracle is how they all cooperate, are integrated </span><span>together, in the creation of a self.</span><br/></p><p>This sense of the brain\u2019s remarkable capacity for <span>the most striking adaptations, not least in the special </span><span>(and often desperate) circumstances of neural or sen</span><span>sory mishap, has come to dominate my perception of </span><span>my patients and their lives. So much so, indeed, that I </span><span>am sometimes moved to wonder whether it may not be </span><span>necessary to redefine the very concepts of \u201chealth\u201d and </span><span>\u201cdisease,\u201d to see these in terms of the ability of the </span><span>organism to create a new organization and order, one </span><span>that fits its special, altered disposition and needs, rather </span><span>than in the terms of a rigidly defined \u201cnorm.\u201d</span></p><p><span>Sickness implies a contraction of life, but such </span><span>contractions do not have to occur. Nearly all of my </span><span>patients, so it seems to me, whatever their problems, </span><span>reach out to life\u2014and not only despite their conditions, </span><span>but often because of them, and even with their aid.</span></p><p>The study of disease, for the physician, demands <span>the study of identity, the inner worlds that patients, </span><span>under the spur of illness, create. But the realities of </span><span>patients, the ways in which they and their brains con</span><span>struct their own worlds, cannot be comprehended </span><span>wholly from the observation of behavior, from the out\u0002 </span><span>side.</span></p><p>With this in mind, I have taken off my white coat, <span>deserted, by and large, the hospitals where I have spent </span><span>the last twenty-five years, to explore my subjects\u2019 lives </span><span>as they live in the real world, feeling in part like a natu</span><span>ralist, examining rare forms of life; in part like an </span><span>anthropologist, a neuroanthropologist, in the field\u2014but </span><span>most of all like a physician, called here and there to </span><span>make house calls, house calls at the far borders of </span><span>human experience.</span></p>", "question": "31.
