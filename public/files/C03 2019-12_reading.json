Imagine walking toward London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was Earth's most populous city. Nearly a million people lived there, making do, as they always had, with candles and rushlights and torches and lanterns. Only a few houses were lit by gas, and there would be no public gaslights in the streets or squares for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have been as likely to smell London as to see its dim collective glow.</p><p>Now most of humanity lives under intersecting domes of reflected, refracted light, of scattering rays from overlit cities and suburbs, from light-flooded highways and factories. Nearly all of nighttime Europe is a nebula of light, as is most of the United States and all of Japan. In the south Atlantic the glow from a single fishing fleet-squid fishermen luring their prey with metal halide lamps-can be seen from space, burning brighter, in fact, than Buenos Aires or Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>In most cities the sky looks as though it has been emptied of stars, leaving behind a vacant haze that mirrors our fear of the dark. We've grown so used to this pervasive orange haze that the original glory of an unlit night-dark enough for the planet Venus to throw shadows on Earth is wholly beyond our experience. And yet above the city's pale ceiling lies the rest of the uni\u00adverse, utterly undiminished by the light we waste\u2014a bright shoal of stars and planets and galaxies, shining in seemingly infinite darkness.</p><p>We've lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country, when nothing could be further from the truth. Among mammal s alone, the number of nocturnal species is astonishing. Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet, a process being studied by researchers such as Travis Longcore and Catherine Rich. The effect is so powerful that scientists speak of song birds and seabirds being \"captured\" by searchlights on land or by the light from gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling and circling in the thousands.</p><p><b>Passage B by Paul Bogard</b></p><p>Unless Vincent Van Gogh 's <i>The Starry Night</i> from 1889 is traveling as part of an exhibition, it hangs at home on its wall at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan as fifty million people pass by every year. On a Saturday morning I stand near VanGogh 's scene of stars and moon and sleeping town , talking with its guardian for the day, Joseph, as he repeats, \"No flash, no flash,\" \"Two feet away,\" and so \"Too close, too close\" again and again as people from around the world crowd near. \"What's the appeal of this painting?\" I ask. \"It's beautiful,\" he says. \"What more can you say than that?\"</p><p>You could rightly leave it at that. But I love the story this painting tells, of a small dark town, a few yellow-orange gaslights in house windows, under a giant swirling and waving blue-green sky. This is a painting of our world from before night had been pushed back to the forest and the seas\uff0cfrom back when sleepy towns slept without streetlights. People are too quick, I think, to imagine the story of this painting-and especially this sky\u2014is simply that of \u201da werewolf of energy,\" as Joachim Pissarro, curator at the MoMA exhibition Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night, would tell me. While Van Gogh certainly had his troubles, this painting looks as it does in part because it's of a time that no longer exists, a time when the night sky would have looked a lot more like this. Does Van Gogh use his imagination? Of course, but this is an imagined sky inspired by a real sky of a kind few of the fifty million MoMA visitors have ever seen. It 's an imagined sky inspired by the real sky over a town much darker than the towns we live in today. So a painting of a night imagined? Sure. But unreal?</p><p>In our age, yes. But Van Gogh lived in a time before electric light. In a letter from the summer of I888, he described what he'd seen while walking a southern French beach:</p><p>The deep blue sky was flecked with clouds of a blue deeper than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt, and others of a clearer blue, like the blue whiteness of the Milky Way. In the blue depth the stars were sparkling, greenish, yellow, white, pink, more brilliant, more sparkling gemlike than at home-even in Paris: opals you might call them, emeralds, lapis lazuli, rubies, sapphires.</p><p>It's remarkable to modem eyes, first of all, that Van Gogh would reference the stars over Paris\u2014no one has seen a sky remotely close to this over Paris for at least fifty years.

We used to jump from those cliffs despite our parents' concerns. I loved this place, and revisiting it I am amazed by all that I can remember. Bends in trails, sap stains on bark, crooks in branches, the intricate web of root structures, the shape of trees-all are startlingly unchanged and I remember them precisely. A small tree is in the middle of the trail. I put my hand on it for support and drops of moisture fall on my back from above, and I realize: I have done this before. I remember the sensation precisely, the sound of rustling leaves above, the freshness of the smell, the temperature of the droplets, the mixture of apprehension and pleasure.

Family, or people from our past who may remind us of events in our lives and with whom we may reminisce, are themselves constantly changing,  as is their version of events. Conversations with others about shared experiences of the past can seem to augment memory but quite often, more often than we probably realize, they operate in the opposite way: they alter or even replace our own memories with those of another.

We fill scrapbooks and hard drives with family outings, vacations, ballgames-Scotty in front of  Niagara Falls, Dad and Grandma smiling in front of the famous restaurant -in the hope of freezing time, making experience tangible for future reference, preserving memory. I do it, too. But it is well to realize that photographs do not preserve memory, they replace memory.

Does a smile in a photograph mean that a person is happy? Or does it mean that a photographer prodded, \"look up and smile\"? Was the fish I caught really bigger than my uncle's, or did I cleverly, intentionally hold mine closer to the lens? Photographs deceive in another respect.

Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen burns clean. Other researchers are working on competing ideas for capturing the sun's energy, such as algae that has been genetically altered to pump out biofuels, or on new biological organisms engineered to excrete oil. All these approaches are intended to turn sunlight into chemical energy that can be stored, shipped and easily consumed.

To power the U.S., Lewis estimates the country would need to manufacture thin, flexible solar-fuel films, instead of discrete chip\u00ad like devices, that roll off high-speed production lines the way newsprint does. The films would have to be as cheap as wall-to-wall carpeting and eventually cover an area the size of South Carolina.</p><p>Far from being a wild dream, direct solar-fuel technology has been advancing in fits and starts ever since President Jimmy Carter's push for alternative energy sources during the l970s oil shocks. Now, with a new energy and climate crunch looming, solar fuel is suddenly gaining attention.</p><p>In photosynthesis, green leaves use the energy in sunlight to rearrange the chemical bonds of water and carbon dioxide, producing and storing fuel in the form of sugars. \"We want to make something as close to a leaf as possible,\" Lewis says, meaning devices that work as simply, albeit producing a different chemical output. The artificial leaf Lewis is designing requires two principal elements: a collector that converts solar energy (photons) into electrical energy (electrons) and an electrolyzer that uses the electron energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. A catalyst\u2014a chemical or metal\u2014 is added to help achieve the splitting. Existing photovoltaic cells already create electricity from sunlight, and electrolyzers are used in various commercial processes, so the trick is marrying the two into cheap, efficient solar films.</p><p><b class=\"now\">Bulky prototypes have been developed just to demonstrate how the marriage would work. Engineers at a Japanese automaker, for example, have built a box that stands taller than a refrigerator and is covered with photovoltaic cells. An electrolyzer, inside, uses the solar electricity to break water molecules. The box releases the resulting oxygen to the ambient air and compresses and stores the remaining hydrogen, which the automaker would like to use to recharge fuel-cell cars.</b></p><p><b class=\"now\">In principle, the scheme could solve global warming: only sunlight and water are needed to create energy, the by-product is oxygen, and the exhaust from burning the hydrogen later in a fuel cell is water. The problem is that commercial solar cells contain expensive silicon crystals. And electrolyzers are packed with platinum, to date the best material for catalyzing the water-splitting reaction, but it costs $1,500 an ounce.</b></p><p>Lewis calculates that to meet global energy demand, future solar-fuel devices would have to cost less than $1 per square foot of sun-collecting surface and be able to convert 10 percent of that light energy into chemical fuel. Fundamentally new, massively seal\u00ad able technology such as films or carpets made from inexpensive materials are needed.<br/></p>", "question": "31.

Lewis has been giving a lecture on the energy crisis that is both terrifying and exhilarating. To avoid potentially debilitating global warming, the chemist says civilization must be able to generate more than 10 trillion watts of clean, carbon-free energy by 2050. That level is three times the U.S.'s average energy demand of 3.2 trillion watts.</p><p>Before Lewis's crowds get too depressed, he tells them there is one source of salvation: the sun pours more energy onto the earth every hour than human kind uses in a year. But to be saved, humankind needs a radical breakthrough in solar-fuel technology: artificial leaves that will capture solar rays and chum out chemical fuel on the spot, much as plants do. We can burn the fuel, as we do oil or natural gas, to power cars, create heat or generate electricity, and we can store the fuel for use when the sun is down.</p><p>Lewis's lab is one of several that are crafting prototype leaves, not much larger than computer chips, designed to produce hydrogen fuel from water, rather than the glucose fuel that natural leaves create. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen burns clean. Other researchers are working on competing ideas for capturing the sun's energy, such as algae that has been genetically altered to pump out biofuels, or on new biological organisms engineered to excrete oil. All these approaches are intended to turn sunlight into chemical energy that can be stored, shipped and easily consumed.
