But the Little Ice Age (approximately A.D. 1300\u20131850) was far from a deep freeze. <span>Think instead of an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic </span><span>shifts, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly  winds,  then  switched  abruptly  to  years  of </span><span>heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves that baked growing corn fields under a shimmering haze. The Little Ice Age was an endless zigzag of climatic </span><span>shifts, few lasting more than a quarter century. Today\u2019s prolonged warming is an anomaly.</span></p><p>Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because reliable instrument records are but a few centuries old. For earlier times, we have but what are called proxy records reconstructed from incomplete written accounts, tree rings, and ice cores. Country clergy and amateur scientists with time on their hands sometimes kept weather records over long periods. Chronicles like those of the eighteenth-century diarist John Evelyn or monastery scribes are invaluable for their remarks on unusual weather, but their useful- ness in making comparisons is limited. Remarks like \u201cthe worst rain storm in memory,\u201d or \u201chundreds of fish- ing  boats overwhelmed by  mighty waves\u201d do  not   an accurate meteorological record make, even if they made a deep impression at the time. The traumas of extreme weather events fade rapidly from human consciousness. Many New Yorkers still vividly remember the great heat wave of Summer 1999, but it will soon fade from collective memory, just like the great New York blizzard of 1888, which stranded hundreds of people in Grand Central station and froze dozens to death in deep snowdrifts.<br/></p><p>A generation ago, we had a generalized  impression of Little Ice Age climate compiled with painstaking care from a bewildering array of  historical sources and  a handful of tree-ring sequences. Today, the scatter of tree-ring records has become hundreds from throughout the Northern Hemisphere and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Green-land, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We can now track the Little Ice Age as an intricate tapestry of short-term climatic shifts that rippled through  European society during times of remarkable change\u2014centuries that saw Europe emerge from medieval fiefdom and pass by stages through the Renaissance, the Age of Discovery, the Enlightenment, the French and Industrial revolutions, and the making of modern Europe.<br/></p><p>To what extent did those climatic shifts alter the course of European history? Many archaeologists and historians are suspicious of the role of  climate change  in changing human societies\u2014and with good reason. Environmental determinism, the  notion  that  climate change was a primary cause of major developments like, say, agriculture, has been a dirty word in academia for generations. You certainly cannot argue that climate drove history in a direct and causative way to  the point of toppling governments. Nor, however, can you con<span>tend that climate change is something that you can totally ignore. Throughout the Little Ice Age, into the nineteenth century, millions of European peasants lived at the subsistence level. Their survival depended on crop yields: cycles of good and poor harvests, of cooler </span><span>and wetter spring weather, could make a crucial difference between hunger and plenty, life and death. The sufficiency or insufficiency of food was a powerful motivator of human action, sometimes on a national or even  continent-wide  scale,  with  consequences  that </span><span>could take decades to unfold.</span></p><p>Consider, for instance, the food crises that engulfed Europe during the Little Ice Age\u2014the great hunger of 1315 to 1319, the food dearths of 1741, and 1816, \u201cthe year without a summer\u201d\u2014to mention only a few. These crises in themselves did not threaten the continued existence of Western civilization, but they surely played an important role in the formation of modern Europe.

When <span>faced with a musical theme, Armstrong improvised an </span></span><span>arrangement that boldly rephrased it, dropping notes he didn\u2019t want to play and adding others. His featured improvisations brought the role of the jazz soloist to the fore. The immaculate logic of  his improvised  melodies, </span><span>full of rhythmic surprises and virtuosic turns, influenced show-tune writers, jazz composers, big band arrangers and tap dancers. His harmonic innovations, as fellow trumpeter Wynton Marsalis has noted, were the most brilliant in  the history of  jazz: Armstrong  figured </span><span>out how to articulate the sound of the blues through Tin Pan Alley popular-music tunes without abandoning their harmonic underpinnings. \u201cLouis Armstrong took two different musics and fused them so that they sounded perfectly compatible,\u201d Mr. Marsalis says.</span></p><p>It was during the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s that Armstrong\u2019s reputation took off. He set the music scene in his home town of New Orleans on fire before traveling to Chicago in 1921 to join his mentor, the cornetist King Oliver. For a year he went to New York, where he joined Fletcher Henderson\u2019s jazz orchestra and turned the rhythm of the music around with his conception of playing with a swinging beat. Now almost a national musical terror, Armstrong returned to Chicago, then finally settled in New York in 1929.<br/></p><p>From 1925 through the early 1930\u2019s, he recorded dozens of masterpieces with large and small bands, popularized scat singing (jazz singing that uses non- sense syllables) and took on Tin Pan Alley, introducing one tune after another into jazz, where they became part of his repertory. His tone could be broad, soft and luminous or vocal or comical, or suddenly and indelibly noble, and when his music conquered Europe in the 30\u2019s, it carried the tragic optimism of the American sensibility into  the  world at  large.  Wherever he  went, swing was sure to follow. He almost single-handedly began a new spirit of freewheeling but perfectly con- trolled improvisation, tinged with playfulness, sorrow and sardonic irony.</p><p>Like  all  innovators, Armstrong was  also called upon to perform superhuman feats. Armstrong had end- less energy and could play and play and play with the evangelical fire and charisma that brings a new art into being. He extended the  range of his  instrument, asserted unprecedented rhythmic fluidity  and  had  the greatest endurance of any trumpet player who ever lived. As a young man, he could play five shows in a theater a day, be the featured soloist on virtually every piece and end each show with 100 high C notes. His <span>glissandos\u2014rapid slides up or down a musical scale</span><span>\u2014</span><span>were so pronounced that trumpeters of the London Philharmonic Orchestra had to inspect his horn to be convinced that it was not made differently from theirs.</span></p><p><b class=\"now\">By his death in 1971, Armstrong had influenced the  entirety  of  American  music,  instrumentally and vocally, inspiring his own generation and successive ones. I can recall some 30 years ago talking with a con- cert percussionist who knew Armstrong and the rest of the people who were rising to the top during the middle and  late  20\u2019s.  Referring  to  a  certain  concert piece, which had a more extensive drum part than usual, he said, \u201cWhen I get that going, I can put my Louis Armstrong influence in and, without them even know- ing it, the orchestra starts to swing for a bit.\u201d On a more recent occasion, unless I was imagining it, I even heard rapper Heavy D slip a phrase over the mechanical hip- hop beat that had an Armstrong arch to it.</b></p><p>To get right down to it, no one in jazz ever played with greater emotional range than Armstrong, whose New  Orleans experiences meant that he worked  everything from christenings to funerals. In the streets, he picked up all the folk chants and songs. While traveling around town, he heard traces of French and Italian opera that suffused his sensibility and his memory. But beyond all that, what Armstrong wanted to give his listeners was the kind of  pleasure music gave him, which  is what most artists are after. When he  wrote or  talked of New Orleans, of being out there with his horn or following the parades or listening to mentors like Joe Oliver, Armstrong never failed to  project a  joy  so  profound that it became an antidote to the blues of daily living. He had a determination to swallow experience whole and taste it all and only then to spit out the bitter parts.<br/></p>", "question": "30.
