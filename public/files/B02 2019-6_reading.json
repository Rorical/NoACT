Suppose, for example, that I played you a number of different musical tones, at random, and asked you to identify each one with a number. If I played you a really low tone, you would call it one, and if I played you a medium tone you would call it two, and a high tone you would call three. The purpose of the test is to find out how long you can continue to distinguish among different tones. Most people can divide tones into only about six different categories before they begin to make mistakes and start lumping different tones in the same category. This is a remarkably consistent finding. If, for example, I played you five very high pitched tones, you\u2019d be able to tell them apart. And if i played you five very low pitched tones, you' d be able to tell them apart. You\u2019d think, then, that if I combined those high and low tones and played them for you all at once, you\u2019d be able to divide them into ten categories. But you won\u2019t be able to. Chances are you\u2019ll still be stuck at about six categories. </p><p>As human beings, we can only handle so much information at once. Once we pass a certain boundary, we become overwhelmed. What I'm describing here is an intellectual capacity\u2014our ability to process raw information. But if you think about it, we clearly have a channel capacity for feelings as well. </p><p>Take a minute, for example to make a, list of all the people whom you would consider yourself truly close to. The average answer is 12 names. Those names make up what psychologists call our sympathy group. Why aren\u2019t groups any larger? Partly It's a question of time. If you look at the names on your sympathy list, they are probably the people whom you devote the most attention to. If your list was twice as long, would you still be as close to everyone? Probably not. To be someone\u2019s friend requires a minimum investment of time. More than that, though, it takes emotional energy. At a certain point, at somewhere between 10 and 15 people, we begin to overload, just as we begin to overload when we have to distinguish between too many tones. </p><p>Perhaps the most interesting natural limit, however, is what might be called our social channel capacity. The case for a social capacity has been made, most persuasively, by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar. Dunbar begins with a simple observation. Primates\u2014monkeys, chimps, baboons, humans\u2014have the biggest brains of all mammals. More important, a specific part of the brain of humans and other primates\u2014 the region known as the neocortex, which deals with complex thought and reasoning\u2014is, huge by mammal standards. For years, scientists have argued back and forth about why this is the case. One theory is that our brains evolved because our primate ancestors began to engage in more sophisticated food gathering: instead of just eating grasses and leaves they began eating fruit, which takes more thinking power. You travel much farther to find fruit than leaves, so you need to be able to create mental maps. You have to worry about ripeness. You have to peel parts away in order to eat the flesh of a fruit, and so on. The problem with that theory is that if you try to match up brain size with eating, patterns among primates, it doesn\u2019t work. So what does correlate with brain size? The answer, Dunbar argues, is group size. If you look at any species of primate\u2014at every variety of monkey and ape\u2014the larger their neocortex is, the larger the average size of the groups they live with. </p><p> Dunbar\u2019s argument is that brains evolve, they get bigger, in order to handle the complexities of larger social groups. If you belong to a group of five people, Dunbar points out, you have to keep track of ten separate relationships: your relationships with the four others in your circle and the six other two-way relationships between the others. That\u2019s what it means to know everyone in the circle. You have to understand the personal dynamics of the group. If you belong to a group of twenty people, however, there are now 190 two-way relationships to keep track of: 19 involving yourself and 171 involving the rest of the group. Even, a relatively small increase in the size of a group creates a significant additional social and intellectual burden. Humans socialize in the: largest groups of all primates because we are the only animals with brains large enough to handle the complexities of that social arrangement.</p>", "question": "11.

We wonder how all those parts work when they\u2019re so small. It\u2019s why we linger over an infant\u2019s fingers and toes, those astonishing replicas: we can\u2019t quite believe they work. Chihuahuas work. Birds and bonsai trees work. Miniatures are improbable, unlikely. Causes to marvel. Surprises. Feats of engineering. Products of an obsessive detailer. </p><p>Miniatures offer changes of scale by which we measure ourselves anew. On one hand, miniatures posit an omniscient onlooker able to take in the whole at once. Consider your<i>self</i> in relation to dollhouses, snowglobes, frog spawn, aquariums, souvenir key-chains you look through to see a picture of the very spot you\u2019re visiting, stilled. You are large enough to hold such things fully in hand. On the other hand, miniatures issue invitations to their realm, and suggest we forget or disregard our size. In dollhouse land, you can walk through the kitchen, livingroom, bedroom with your three inch high friend and, face pressed to the window, feel the cushions of the thumbnail loveseat hold you. Fit inside the miniature, we experience certain states of being or belief: worlds in a grain of sand; eternities in wildflowers. Regions beyond our normal-sized perception. Whether we: are, in relation to them, omniscient or companionably small beings, miniatures invite us to leave our known selves and perspectives behind. </p><p>Miniatures encourage attention\u2014in the way whispering requires a listener to quiet down and incline toward the speaker. Sometimes we need binoculars, microscopes, viewmasters to assist our looking, but mediated or not, miniatures suggest there is more there than meets the eye easily. They suggest there is much to miss if we don\u2019t look hard at spaces, crevices, crannies. </p><p>The miniature, a working, functioning complete world unto itself, is not merely a \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cbrief\u201d thing or a \u201cshortened\u201d form of something larger. Miniatures transcend their size. Most strangely to me, miniatures are radically self-sufficient. The beings who inhabit fairylands, those elves and sprites, pixies and trolls, don\u2019t usually strive to be our pals. They don\u2019t need us. Their smallness is our problem, or intrigue, or desire. </p><p>Passage B by James Gardner </p><p>Without meaning to do so, the Morgan Library has created a triumph of conceptual art: the smallest art exhibition in the world. \u201cThe Prayer Book of Claude de France,\u201d as the exhibition is called, consists of nothing other than \u201cThe Prayer Book of Claude de France.\u201d At 2 3/4 by 2 inches, the exhibition and the book are both so small that they can fit in the palm of your hand. That may not sound like much until you realize that this illuminated miniature contains- 132 scenes from the lives of Christ, the virgin, the apostles, and sundry saints. As such, it is a gallery unto itself. </p><p>In \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of, Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d Walter Benjamin\u2019s overrated essay of 1936, the author famously asserted that no one would feel the need to stand before the original when one could own a reproduction. The folly of this idea will be self-evident to anyone with the remotest sensitivity to visual art. No matter how good a reproduction, you have to bear physical witness to each pucker and weave of canvas, each splash of puddled ink in an Old Master drawing. Only then can you truly say that you have seen the work of art. </p><p>It was with such convictions that I rushed over to the Morgan to see the tiny commodity in question. What a waste of time! Not because the object is lacking in worthiness, but because the Morgan\u2019s own Web site offers a means of examining the book that, in this case, far surpasses any direct encounter. Every page of the manuscript is there in living color, and the zoom mechanism is so powerful and so precise that you can get in closer than if you were hunched over the real thing with a strong magnifying glass. Zoom in to one of the figures, scarcely the size of a fingernail, and you see the tiny head in perfect focus. Zooming in deeper, you see the beard on the head, then the hairs on the beard, then the point at which the whole thing dissolves into abstract art, as the strokes of the artist's single-hair brush merge with the warped and mottled surface of the vellum. </p><p>The miniature in question was commissioned for Queen Claude of France. Nearly three generations after the invention of printing, there was no practical reason to commission this work. Rather, it was the delight in luxury itself, as well, perhaps, as the spirit of sacrifice that brought this work into existence.</p>", "question": "30.
