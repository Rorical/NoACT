The success of Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's book <i>The Hidden Life of Dogs</i> is evidence of the human desire to peer inside the minds of animals\u2014and to see something of ourselves there. Drawing on 30 years of observations, anthropologist Thomas speculates on the inner lives of canines, from huskies to dingoes. She faces head-on the charge of anthropomorphism, stating in her introduction that \"our aversion to the label is misplaced .\"</span></p><p><span>Thomas is not alone in calling for a reevaluation of one of science's most stringent commandments. Some researchers maintain that by bending over back ward to avoid human-centered thinking, they have missed many intriguing aspects of animal reasoning and behavior and ignored continuities that do in fact exist among species as varied as humans, monkeys, birds, and dolphins.</span></p><p><span>Psychologist Theodore X. Barber sprinkles human simile as freely as birdseed throughout <i>The human Nature of Birds</i>, the fruit of six years of intensive study of avian literature, from anecdotal reports to lab experiments and field notebooks. Humankind, he concludes does not have a monopoly over language. Like \"nonliterate humans,\" he contends, birds \"speak\" with their eyes, their beaks, and feathers about \"important daily events\" ranging from rain to offspring. \"They can be contented and happy and even ecstat</span><span>ic as well as sad and hopeless and forlorn. They can manifest parental love, close friendships, and erotic love.</span></p><p>Gordon Burghardt, who teaches animal behavior at the University of Tennessee, coined the term and articulated the discipline of \"critical anthropomorphism\" to permit scientists to gain insight, through human comparisons, into what an animal might be thinking\u2014while remaining ever cognizant of its life history, biology, and ecology. Burghardt's goal is to encourage hard-headed scientific testing of anthropomorphic hypotheses about various animals.</p><p> Burghardt is critical of anthropomorphic thinking that begins and ends with anecdotes. He recalls the work of the 19th-century researcher who reported ants carrying other dead ants on their backs and enthusiastically deduced that these were funeral processions to <span>honor the dead. Later research revealed that the dead ants were merely being hauled out to the garbage pit.</span></p><p>Burghardt's cautious approach wins the praise even of usually skeptical animal behaviorists Psychologist Hank Davis, for example, has used this approach to animal cognition in his own lab. Testing the controversial supposition that research animals bond with laboratory scientists, Davis placed a rat in the middle of a long table with a stranger on one end and a person who handled, petted, and fed the rat daily on the other. After the rat investigated the two individuals by sniffing them, she climbed onto the familiar person and nestled under her hair. Davis tested 26 laboratory rats this way, with a variety of sophisticated experimental controls, and found that all chose the familiar person over the stranger. \"It was tremendously exciting because the effect was so clear,\" Davis says. \"I don't feel there was a problem with anthropomorphism I report the choice and I stop there.

London soup chefs and victualing ships of Her Majesty's Navy found and exploited these turtles long ago. But they did not suspect, as Archie Carr discovered by tagging animals at Ascension and recovering them later at their feeding grounds, that <i>Chelonia</i> travels 2,000 miles from the Coast of Brazil to, breed on this \"pinpoint of land hundreds of miles from other shores,\" this \"barely exposed spire in mid-ocean\".</p><p>Turtles feed and breed on separate grounds for good reasons. They feed on sea grasses in protected, shallow-water pastures, but breed on exposed shore where sandy beaches develop\u2014preferably, on islands here predators are rare. But why travel 2,000 miles to the middle of an ocean when other, apparently appropriate breeding grounds are so much nearer? (Another large population of the same species breeds on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica.)</p><p>Perhaps, Carr reasoned, this odyssey is a peculiar extension of something much more sensible, a journey to an island in the middle of the Atlantic, when the Atlantic was little more than a puddle between two continents recently separated. South America and Africa parted company some 80 million years ago, when ancestors of the genus <i>Chelonia</i> were already present in the area. Ascension is an island associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a linear belt where new sea floor <b class=\"now\">wells up from the earth's interior.</b> This upwelling material often piles itself high enough to form islands.</p><p>Iceland is the largest modern island formed by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Ascension is a smaller version of the same process. After islands form on one side of a ridge, they a<span>re pushed away by new material welling up and spreading out. Thus, islands tend to be older as we move farther and farther from a ridge. But they also tend to get smaller and finally to erode away into underwater seamounts, for their supply of new material dries up once they drift away from an active ridge. Unless preserved and built up by a shield of coral or other organisms, islands will eventually be eroded below sea level by waves.</span></p><p><span>Carr therefore proposed that the ancestors of Ascension green turtles swam a short distance from Brazil to a \"proto-Ascension\" on the late Cretaceous Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As this island moved out and sank, a new one formed at the ridge and the turtles ventured a bit farther. This process continued until turtles found themselves locked into a 2,000-mile journey. The hatchlings float to Brazil on the Equatorial Current, but how do they get back? Carr supposes that they begin their journey by celestial cues and finally home in by </span><span>remembering the character (taste? smell?) of Ascension water when they detect the island's wake.</span></p><p><span>Carr's hypothesis is an excellent example of using the peculiar to reconstruct history. I wish I could believe it. I am not troubled by the empirical difficulties, for these do not render the theory implausible. Can we be confident, for example, that a new island always arose in time to replace an old one\u2014for the absence of an island for even one generation would disrupt the system. And would the new islands always arise sufficiently \"on course\" to be found? Ascension itself is less than seven million years old.</span></p><p><span>I am more bothered by a theoretical difficulty. If the entire species <i>Chelonia mydas</i> migrated to Ascension I would have no objection, for behavior can be as ancient and as heritable as form.
