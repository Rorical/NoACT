Ellis).</p><p>The most famous section of the Declaration of Independence, which has become the most quoted statement of human rights in recorded history as well as the most eloquent justification of revolution on behalf of them, went through the Continental Congress without comment and with only one very minor change. There are, in all probability, the best-known fifty-eight words in American history: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inherent and inalienable Rights; tha<span>t among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d This is the seminal statement of the American Creed, the closest approximation to political poetry ever produced in American culture. In the nineteenth century Abraham Lincoln, who also knew how to change history with words, articulated with</span> characteristic eloquence the q<span>uasi-religious view of Tomas Jefferson as the origin</span>al American oracle: \u201cAll honor to Jefferson\u2014to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people, had the coolness, forecast, and capacity to introduce into a merely embalm it there, that today and in all coming days, it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression.\u201d</p><p>No serious student of either Jefferson or the Declaration of Independence has ever claimed that he foresaw all or even most of the ideological consequences of what he wrote. But the effort to explain what was in his head has spawned almost as many interpretations as the words themselves have generated political movements. Jefferson himself was accused of plagiarism by enemies or jealous friends on so many occasions throughout his career that he developed a standard reply. \u201cNeither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing,\u201d he explained, he drew his ideas from \u201cthe harmonizing sentiments of the day, whether expressed in letters, printed essays or in the elementary books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, Sidney, etc.\u201d</p><p><span>This is an</span> ingeniously double-edged exp<span>lanation, for it simultaneously disavows any claims to originality and yet insists that he depended upon no specific texts or sources. The image it conjures up is that of a medium, sitting along at he writing desk and making himself into an instrument for the accumulated wisdom and \"harmonizing sentiments\" of the ages. It is only a short step from this image to Lincoln\u2019s vision of Jefferson as oracle of prophet, receiving the message form the gods and sending it on to us and then to the ages. Given the character of the natural rights section of Declaration, several generations of American interpreters have felt the irresistible impulse to bathe the scene in speckled light and cloudy mist, thereby implying that efforts to dispel the veil of mystery represent some vague combination of sacrilege and treason.</span></p><p><span>Any serious attempt to pierce through this veil must begin by recovering the specific conditions inside that room on Market and Seventh streets in June 1776. </span>Even if we take Jefferson at his words, that he did not copy sections of the Declaration from any particular books,<span> he almost surely had with him copies of his own previous writings, to include </span><i>Summer View, Causes and Necessities</i><span> and his three drafts of the Virginia constitution. This is not to accuse him of plagiarism, unless one wishes to argue that an author can plagiarize himself. It is to say that virtually all the ideas found in the Declaration and much of the specific language had already found expression in those earlier writings.</span></p><p><span><b class=\"now\">Recall the context. The Congress is being overwhelmed with military reports of imminent American defeat in New York and Canada. The full Congress is in session six days a week, and committees are meeting throughout the evenings.</b> The obvious practical course for Jefferson to take was to rework his previous drafts on the same general theme. While it seems almost sacrilegious to suggest that the creative process that produced the Declaration was a cut-and-paste job, it strains credulity and common sense to the breaking point to believe that Jefferson did not have these items at his elbow and draw liberally from them when drafting the Declaration.</span></p><p></p>", "question": "20.
