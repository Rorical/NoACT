In fact, nearly every culture has legends about them. The first person <b>initially</b> to offer a scientific explanation of rainbows was Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In 1637 he correctly <b>hypothesized that</b> rainbows occur when suspended water droplets refract light, separating it into an arc-shaped spectrum of colors. Typically you look for rainbows when the sun shines through rain, but under the right circumstances, a bright full moon can supply enough light to create a lunar rainbow.</p><p>Lunar <b>rainbows, or \"moonbows,\"</b> are little known <b>and, in that way, are like some other aspects of the natural world.</b> <span>The moon must be full and low in the sky, </span><b>and</b><span> rain </span><span>must be falling. Also, because moonlight is less powerful </span><b>then sunlight,</b><span> lunar rainbows are faint and easily </span><span>obscured by surrounding lights and air pollution.</span> (52)</p><p>Just as the sun is behind you when you see a solar rainbow, the moon is behind <b>you when you see</b> a lunar rainbow. When a moonbow appears in front of you, <b>its</b> center lies in the direction exactly opposite that of the moon. Although moonlight strikes the falling rain and separates its light into the same spectrum of color present in a solar rainbow, a lunar rainbow is likely to be perceived as a delicate white arc against the dark night sky, <b>and which</b> poorly illuminated objects appear colorless at night. <b>In fact, the</b> human eye loses its sensitivity to color at low levels of illumination, a camera with a very long exposure setting can capture a lunar <b>rainbows' colors.</b></p><p>Like solar rainbows, <b>the observers of lunar rainbows</b> are easier to find near waterfalls. Tourist bureaus in places such as Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe list lunar rainbows as local attractions. Moonbows were reportedly once a common sight at both the New York and Canadian parts <span>of Niagara Falls before bright surrounding lights made them impossible to see. You can still </span><b>witness</b><span> them at Yosemite Falls in California and at Cumberland Falls in Kentucky.</span></p>", "question": "60.
