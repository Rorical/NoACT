Instead, these desert penguins seek out caves to shade their eggs from the sun.</p><p>To see these penguins, visitors usually begin in La Serena, Chile. They drive 40 miles north on a main highway and then cut toward the cost on a gravel road that leads to the fishing village of Punta de Choros. Local fishermen there charge a fee to guide the tourists to Damas by boat. On the island, people are free to walk into the caves where the penguins live. Anyone can watch a mother brooding an egg and snap a picture.</p><p>What began in the early 1990s as a place with a few hundred curious visitors has now become a tourism destination that attracts 10,000 penguin peepers a year. Damas provide an example of ecotourism, defined as the practice of visiting sites where exotic landscapes and rare animals are the main attractions to conserve them, and generate income for host communities.</p><p>Since this model of tourism emerged some 25 years ago, many special-interest sites, like Damas, have experienced hikes in visitation.</p><p>But several recent studies show a more complicated picture of the impact of ecotourism, a practice that remains largely unregulated. The increased crowds lead to population changes in some animals, such as the Humboldt penguin and, some 4,000 miles away in the Bahamas, the Allen Cays rock iguana. A mounting garbage problem caused by over-visitation by turtle viewers threaten the beaches of Tortuguero in Costa Rica. People who live near Ghana\u2019s Kakum National Park have lost access to the forest\u2019s resources and now suffer high rates of unemployment.</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s been a glib\u2026championing of ecotourism, that it\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d says Martha Honey, executive director of the Center on Ecotourism and Sustainable Development in Washington, D.C. But by studying how animals, environment, and cultures respond to ecotourism, \u201cwe can set up systems that aren\u2019t having adverse impact.\u201d she says.</p><p>Ursula Ellenberg, a biologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, decided to study how human disturbance affects the Humboldt penguins when she was quietly counting their population, but not quietly enough. While she was looking through binoculars from a cliff about 150 meters away, the penguins began racing in all directions. If a cautious researchers can spark such a reaction, she thought, how would the penguins react to a gaggle of shutter-happy tourists?</p><p>To study the effects of human-Humboldt interaction, Ellenberg and her colleagues measured the breeding success of penguins on the island of Damas, Choros, and Chanaral, which together make up the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve. The island cluster serves as a good point of comparison: Damas receives 10,000 annual visitors, but Choros and Chanaral are much less accessible from the mainland and attract only 1,000 and 100 tourists a year, respectively.</p><p>Ellenberg\u2019s team was the first to study these penguin populations. The researchers monitored eggs, and chicks on each island for 5 months after the penguin mothers laid the eggs. If a nest is abandoned during this period, the chicks usually die. Penguins have many chance to breed during their 20-year life spans, and they would sooner abandon a nest than risk personal harm\u2014say, from an approaching human.</p><p>In 2003, the only year that Ellenberg\u2019s group studied Chanaral, the penguins there bred an average of L34 chicks. On Choros, the average was just below one chick in both 2002 and 2003. But on Damas, female penguin produced, on average, a little less than half a chick in 2002, and the birthrate dipped well below a quarter of a chick in 2003, Ellenberg\u2019s team reports.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprising, when you have islands at such close proximity, that you\u2019d already get a difference,\u201d says Ellenberg. \u201cThey should do similarly well.\u201d</p><p>As scientist study ecotourism\u2019s impacts, new understandings \u201cneed to be fed back into the industry, to educate what is acceptable behavior,\u201d says Honey. <b class=\"now\">\u201cThere needs to be a closer alliance between hard science and the tourism industry.\u201d</b></p><p>In the case of the Humboldt penguins, a lack of research led to improper viewing guidelines, says Ellensburg. The Humboldt reserve based on its rules for approaching penguins on a related South American species called the Magellanic penguin, which is far less sensitive to human disturbance.</p>", "question": "20.

Reynolds (\u00a92001 by Scientific American, Inc.).</p><p>For many years, we have known that an extremely thin atmosphere called the interstellar medium envelops our galaxy, the Milky Way, and threads the space between its billions of stars. Until fairly recently, the medium seemed a cold, static reservoir of gas quietly waiting to condense into stars. Now we recognize the medium as a tempestuous mixture with an extreme diversity of density, temperature and ionization.</p><p>In fact, telescopes on the ground and in the space show the galaxy\u2019s atmosphere to be as complex as any planet\u2019s. Held by the combined gravitational pull of the stars and other matter, permeated by starlight, energetic particles and a magnetic field, the interstellar medium is continuously stirred, heated, recycled and transformed. Like any atmosphere, it has its highest density and pressure at the \u201cbottom,\u201d in this case the plane that defines the middle of the galaxy, where the pressure must balance the weight of the medium from \u201cabove.\u201d Dense concentrations of gas\u2014clouds\u2014from near the midplane, and from the densest subcondensations, stars precipitate.</p><p>When stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and die, those that are at least as massive as the sun expel much of their matter back into the interstellar medium. Thus, as the galaxy ages, each generation of stars pollutes the medium with heavy elements. As in the water cycle on Earth, precipitation is followed by \u201cevaporation,\u201d so that material can be recycled over and over again.</p><p>Thinking of the interstellar medium as a true atmosphere brings unity to some of the most pressing problems in astrophysics. First and foremost is star formation. Although astronomers have known the basic principles for decades, they still do not grasp exactly what determines when and at what rate stars precipitate from the interstellar medium. Theorists used to explain the creation of stars only in terms of the local conditions within an isolated gas cloud. Now they are considering conditions in the galaxy as a whole.</p><p>Not only do these conditions influence star formation, they are influenced by it. What one generation of stars does determines the environment in which subsequent generations are born, live and die. Understanding this feedback is another of the great challenges for researchers. Feedback can be both positive and negative. On the one hand, massive stars can heat and ionize the medium and cause it to bulge out from the midplane. This expansion increases the ambient pressure, compressing the clouds and perhaps triggering their collapse into a new generation of stars. On the other hand, the heating and ionization can also agitate clouds, inhibiting the birth of new stars. When the largest star blow up, they can even destroy the clouds that gave them birth. In fact, nagetive feedback could explain why the gravitational collapse of clouds into stars so inefficient. Typically only a few percent of a cloud\u2019s mass becomes stars.</p><p>A third conundrum is that star formation often occurs in sporadic but intense bursts. In the Milky Way the competing feedback effects almost balance out, so that stars form at an unhurried pace\u2014just 10 per year on average. In some galaxies, however, such as the \u201cexploding galaxy\u201d M82, positive feedback has gained the upper hand. Starting 20 million to 50 million years ago, star formation in the central parts of M82 began running out of control, proceeding 10 times faster than before. Our galaxy, too, may have had sporadic bursts. How these starbursts occur and what turns them off must be tied to the complex relation between stars and the tenuous atmosphere from which they precipitate.</p><p>Finally, astronomers debate how quickly the atmospheric activity is petering out. The majority of stars\u2014those less massive than the sun, which live tens or even hundreds of billions of year\u2014do not contribute to the feed back loops. More and more of the interstellar gas is being locked up into very long lived stars. Eventually all the spare gas in our Milky Way may be exhausted, leaving only stellar dregs behind. How soon this will happen depend on whether the Milky Way is a closed box. Recent observation suggest that the galaxy is still an open system, both gaining and losing mass to its cosmic surroundings. High velocity clouds of relatively unpolluted hydrogen appear to be raining down from intergalactic space, rejuvenating our galaxy. Meanwhile the galaxy may be shedding gas in the form of a high-speed wind from its outer atmosphere, much as the sun slowly sheds mass in the solar wind.</p>", "question": "31.
