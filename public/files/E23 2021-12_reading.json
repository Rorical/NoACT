There were the type forms and tables, </span><span>the linotype machine (a new and fearsome invention to </span><span>me), the small press, the big newspaper press, the boiler </span><span>plate, the trays of type, all the paraphernalia that goes </span><span>to make up the heart of a small-town newspaper. The </span><span>front room is its head, but without the back room it </span><span>could not function or even live. The linotype and the </span><span>small press went all day, for there the advertising was </span><span>set up and printed, as well as handbills, programs, all </span><span>the odds and ends classified as job printing. Mac, who </span><span>ruled this domain, was the perfect example of the fictional </span><span>printer. He had come in years before, his brown </span><span>hair curled over a mild brow, his limp shirt seemed </span><span>perennial. But his eye was infallible, and few if any </span><span>shrdlus and etaoins marred the fair sequence of Mac\u2019s </span><span>copy. His voice was soft, gentle, drawling, but he was </span><span>boss of the print shop from the cat to the linotype operator. </span><span>Mac seldom talked but sometimes\u2014rarely\u2014he </span><span>appeared in the front office, a drooping figure, with a </span><span>piece of news by which he had come in some devious </span><span>way. Standing at the side of the city editor\u2019s desk he </span><span>would deliver himself of this information, looking mild </span><span>and limply romantic. It always proved to be a </span><span>bombshell.</span></p><p>Such was the make-up of the Appleton, Wisconsin, <span>Daily Crescent office.</span></p><p>In the past thirty years all sorts of ex-newspaper <span>men from Richard Harding Davis to Vincent Sheean </span><span>and John Gunther have written about the lure of the </span><span>reporter's life, the smell of printer's ink, the adventure </span><span>of reporting. It all sounds slightly sentimental and silly, </span><span>but it's true\u2014or it was, at least, in my newspaper experience. </span><span>To this day I can't smell the scent of white </span><span>paper, wet ink, oil, hot lead, mucilage and cats that goes </span><span>to make up the peculiar odor of any newspaper plant, be </span><span>it Appleton, Wisconsin, or Cairo, Egypt, that I don\u2019t get </span><span>a pang of nostalgia for the old reporting days. \"I was </span><span>once a newspaper man myself\" has come to be a fun </span><span>phrase. But practically everyone seems to have been, or </span><span>to have wanted to be, a newspaper reporter.</span></p><p>Passage B by Dan Barry</p><p>Ink. The building smelled of ink, spilled and bled. <span>It was a tart and chemical smell, the kind that weaves </span><span>into the fabric of your clothes and then under your skin, </span><span>the kind that comes home with you, sits with you at the </span><span>dinner table, tells you constantly what it is you do. Car </span><span>mechanics know their smell, as do fishermen and hair </span><span>stylists, nurses and short-order cooks. You are a man </span><span>who chases halibut, a woman who perms hair. You </span><span>smell of it.</span></p><p>I waded into that invisible veil of ink, inhaled it <span>deeply, allowed it to wash over me. It smelled of words </span><span>and phrases, rants and ideas, sports scores and felony </span><span>arrests, announcements of marriage and notices of </span><span>death. Maybe the chemical-like aroma was inducing </span><span>hallucination, but I doubted it. In a squat concrete </span><span>building, no different from all the others in a drab Connecticut </span><span>industrial park, I was experiencing a moment </span><span>of revelation\u2014an epiphany, really, at the age of </span><span>twenty-five.</span></p><p>This is what I do.</p><p>Pinned like a manifesto to a bulletin board in the <span>center of this ink-perfumed building was a typewritten </span><span>note from my new employer, announcing that on this </span><span>day, October 17, 1983, I would begin working as a </span><span>reporter for a daily newspaper.
