But I suspect he just loves to feed us. I enjoy the snacks, but it's the stories I really crave. He has told us about his early days as a student in America, about the odd jobs he held to make money\u2014a janitor in a hospital, a slot-machine repairman in a casino. About the people he met in these places. I would never have guessed that such a consummate storyteller lay waiting all these years inside my father. He prolongs the suspense until we're about to shake him; he makes us burst out laughing at unexpected jokes. My favorite stories are about his life in India. But so far he has not told us any stories involving my mother, though he does mention her\u2014lovingly, ruefully\u2014in passing.<br/><br/>From time to time my father sings as he cooks, mostly songs from the movies, though sometimes a haunting tune that sounds far older will wind like wood smoke through the store.They make me restless, these tunes, as though there is something inside my chest that wants to escape. There's a feeling like pinpricks in my fingers, a need to paint\u2014something I haven't been able to do since my mother's death.<br/><br/>When I ask, he tells me these are folk songs that field hands sing in Bengal. He picked them up during school holidays when he visited his uncle, who was the subestate manager for the royal family of Nataal. I sense a story there. No, stories tucked within the envelopes of other stories, an entire post office worth of them, filling me with giddy anticipation.<br/><br/>But today my father tells us this is no time for lolling around, listening to foolish tales. Tomorrow's a big day. Flye<span>rs have been passed out via Marco and his friends, advertisements have been placed in the <i>East Bay Express and India West</i>. I've given in and let my father deploy Sonny as our publicist, and he's been talking up our new concept at the nightclub. We must </span><span>be ready, my father insists. He needs to make another batch of gawja, those crisp diamonds of fried dough crusted with sugar. </span><span>He wasn't satisfied with the consistency of the melted sugar last time. We assure him that the gawjas were delicious, but he shakes his head. </span><span>Nothing less than perfection will do for our reopening, as grand he calls it. He assigns Belle the task of writing our new menu on the board. She asks if she should provide brief descriptions of the items, but he says no. No pandering to tourist types here, he adds sternly. This is a real cha shop. If people ask, you can explain. But you'll be surprised at how much they know already\u2014and how much they can learn on their own. Jespal, who has just come in, is set to dusting the furniture.As for me, he shoos me outside to paint. The new name has to be dry by the time we open tomorrow. </span><span>I comply, a little taken aback by his bustling, managerial manner. </span><span>Is there no end to the personalities hiding inside my father's skin?

Historically, prairie dog towns followed the bison, aerating the soil after the great stampedes. These towns could range in size from one to one thousand acres. Many in the Great Plains seemed to spread as far as the horizon. Within these communities are family units called <i>coteries</i>. A coterie, consisting of a single adult male, one to four adult females, and offspring up to two years old, can occupy a territory up to about an acre.<br/><br/><b class=\"now\">As above, so below. One could consider the double life of prairie dogs.</b><br/><br/>Above ground, prairie dog colonies literally change the land. Mounds created from the excavation of burrows may be two feet high and ten feet in diameter. These serve as lookout posts and will keep the burrows dry from rain. Prairie dogs' communication system is sophisticated.Biologists have identified twelve different vocalizations and a variety of postures and behavioral displays. One researcher studying a Utah prairie dog population near Bryce Canyon National Park noted specific calls, distinguishing between the calls made when a truck versus a coyote crossed into their territory.When danger is near, a series of barks occurs in a prairie dog chorus, often led by sentinel dogs guarding the periphery of the colony. The word spreads. They quickly scramble and scurry across the desert and disappear into nearby holes. When danger seems to have passed, a prairie dog will carefully emerge, look in all directions, then stand on its mound and throw back its head, with its hands raised in what looks like a gesture of prayer, and give what has been called a <i>jump-yip</i> call that the coast is clear.<br/><br/>It is also common to see prairie dogs engage in <span>what looks like kissing. The\u201ckiss\" is used to distinguish one coterie member from another. When prairie dogs recognize each other, they will participate in elaborate grooming behavior. If one of the prairie dogs is an intruder, teeth may be bared, territory fought over, claimed, or reclaimed by dominant males. In most cases the outsider flees.</span></p><p>Below ground, a burrow will typically be three to six feet deep and about fifteen feet long, although the size varies tremendously, depending on the landscape. Prairie dogs will often dig small chambers to the side of the main burrow where they can listen to what is going on above. Deeper inside the burrows, they make nests out of grasses they have pulled under, where they will sleep, give birth, and care for their young (four is the norm) in spring, with the babies usually not emerging until June. Native grasses make up 70 to 95 percent of their diet during the summer, changing to seeds and insects, even roots, as fall and winter approach.<br/><br/><span>Prairie dogs create habitat not only for themselves but also for other grassland species. With their mounds and extensive burrowing systems (black-tailed prairie dogs typically have thirty to fifty burrow entrances per acre, while Gunnison's and white-tailed prairie dogs have fewer than twenty), their underground world is not simply the haunt of prairie dogs but home to myriad other creatures as well. One study of black-tailed prairie dogs identified more than 140 species of wildlife associated with prairie dog towns. In a grassland community historically tamped down by the weight of stampeding bison, burrowing prairie dogs loosen and aerate the soil, keeping the land supple. In the spring and summer, they also spend most of their time foraging above ground. A single prairie dog may consume two pounds of green grasses and forbs per week. Their hunger alters the landscape.</span></p><p>Prairie dogs' digging and scratching stimulates the soil, creating greater opportunities for seeds to germinate. With heightened water drainage due to the tunnels, plants grow. Plant diversity follows. Animal diversity follows the plants. Meadowlarks appear with an appetite for grasshoppers. Grasshopper sparrows appear in the abundance of seeds. Vacant or abandoned prairie dog burrows become the homes of cottontails, kangaroo rats, and deer mice. Burrowing owls, with their long, spindly legs, stand on the former mounds of prairie dogs with an eye for the multiplying mice. One successful life inspires another, creating the strength of a grassland community. If the prairie dog goes, so goes an entire ecosystem, including the black-footed ferret and burrowing owl, which now are endangered and threatened species.

Historically, prairie dog towns followed the bison, aerating the soil after the great stampedes. These towns could range in size from one to one thousand acres. Many in the Great Plains seemed to spread as far as the horizon. Within these communities are family units called <i>coteries</i>. A coterie, consisting of a single adult male, one to four adult females, and offspring up to two years old, can occupy a territory up to about an acre.<br/><br/>As above, so below.
