This was not simply artistic license on van Gogh's part but a faithful reproduction of a mutant variety of sunflower. Researchers at the University of Georgia report that they have pinned down the gene responsible for the mutation, which could shed light on the evolution of floral diversity.</p><p>A wild sunflower is not so much a single flower as a composite of tiny florets. The golden ray florets, located at the sunflower's rim, resemble long petals, are bilaterally symmetrical and do not produce pollen. That job belongs to the disc florets, tiny radially symmetrical blossoms that occupy the sunflower's darker centre. In combination, the two types of florets create the impression of a single large flower, and presumably an attractive target for insect pollinators.</p><p>Because changes in floral symmetry can affect how a plant interacts with pollinators\u2014and therefore its reproductive fitness\u2014the unusual sunflowers depicted by van Gogh piqued plant biologist John Burke's curiosity.</p><p>He says that the diversity of traits seen in many species of flowering plants are thought to be related to the \u2019<i>CYC</i>-like\u2018 class of genes, named after the gene<span> <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>. <i>CYC</i>-like genes control DNA transcription and influence floral morphology in <i>Gerbera</i> daisies and flowering weeds from the <i>Senecio</i> genus\u2014which belong to the same family as sunflowers\u2014but their function in sunflowers has been less understood.</span></p><p>\u201cIt's been hypothesized that these genes could be responsible for driving the evolution of floral head diversity,\u201d says Burke.</p><p>Double-flowered mutants present geneticists with a practical challenge as their relative lack of pollen makes it difficult to generate offspring. To surmount this, the researchers began by crossing a wild-type sunflower with a partial double-flowered mutant and then allowing the offspring to self-pollinate. Among the offspring was a new mutant with 'tubular' flowers, so named because of their resemblance to soda straws. The researchers soon traced the differences between mutant and wild-type sunflowers to insertions of chunks of DNA in the gene<span> <i>HaCYC2c</i>. In the double-flowered mutants, there was one insertion; in the tubular flowers, there were two.</span></p><p>Previous studies had shown that<span> <i>HaCYC2c</i> is </span>highly expressed in ray flowers.
