When my older siblings heard of the trade, they teased me for giving away a fortune. Out of pride, I insisted they were wrong, but I wondered secretly if they were right.</p><p>That's when I started researching and collecting coins in earnest. By the time I learned that coin collecting, or numismatics, <b>had begun</b> in the Italian Renaissance, I <b>am developing</b> a habit of checking every handful of change for a rare or old coin\u2014or one that was both. Every so often I'd find a Lincoln penny with the \"wheat\" design on the <span>back. One time a vending machine gave me a \"buffalo\" </span><span>nickel in </span><b>change. Another</b><span> time my weekly allowance </span><span>included a dime with an incorrect mint mark; such a defect </span><span>makes a coin particularly valuable.</span></p><p>Collecting coins brings other time periods into focus. For instance, the change in the metal composition of U.S. <b>coins, minted during World War II,</b> points out the adjustments made as part of the war effort. (69) Information, stories, a sense of other settings and other lives\u2014these all <b>accumulate to</b> the appeal of coins for collectors like me. <b>Nevertheless, I enjoy</b> attaching stories to the coins I own and to the coins I don't. I wonder, for instance, where that <b>collectible coin</b> is now. In a bus driver's pocket? In a box lined with velvet? Wherever <b>those are, they</b> will always clink around with all the <span>others in my imaginatio</span>n.(74)</p>", "question": "75.
