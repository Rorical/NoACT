Dr. Griffin observed as Gus, 800 pounds, tried to fit his nose into an enticingly sticky knothole. To the untutored eye it looked like just another feeding time at the zoo, but at Central Park the exercise with the log and snack does by the grander name of \u201canimal enrichment\u201d and is intended to stimulate the bears\u2019 mind as well as their appetites. It\u2019s a concept for which the bear have Dr. Griffin, 85, in large part to thank.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago he published a short book suggesting that human didn\u2019t have the monopoly on thoughts and feelings. Animals, he argued, most likely had them, too.</p><p>Other scientists were appalled. According to the behaviorist doctrine that held sway at the time, animals were little more than \u201cstimulus response automata,\u201d robots with a central nervous system. The idea that an ant or an elephant might have thoughts, images, experience or beliefs was not just laughable; it was seditious.</p><p>But over the last decades alone a flood of new data have emerged that would seem to have turned the tide definitively in Dr. Griffin\u2019s favor. In Arizona an African Gray parrot named Alex can identify colors and shapes as well as any preschooler. In Georgia a bonobo ape named Kanzi converses with his trainer via computer keyboard and watches Tarzan movies on television. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published evidence suggesting that rats dream. Animals enrichment programs featuring mental puzzles disguised as toys and treats have become a standard part of daily life at zoos. And in the spring of 2001 the University of Chicago Press issued an updated edition of Dr. Griffin\u2019s 1992 book, <i>Animal Minds</i>.</p><p>If Dr. Griffin views these developments as vindication, he is too modest to say so. \u201cWe know so very little,\u201d he said, \u201cscientists, include me, have come to be very cautious. Early work on primate gesture and facial expressions was grossly misinterpreted.\u201d</p><p>In fact the recent findings appear to have only intensified the debate over animal consciousness. Lately, experts on the human mind\u2014philosophers and psychologists\u2014have been weighing in alongside the scientists. For if it turn out that animals can think , then the idea that consciousness is unique to humans\u2014a basic assumption in Western thought\u2014becomes impossible to maintain.</p><p>Clearly Gus, Alex and Kanzi aren\u2019t automatons, but just how conscious are they? Do they experience pain, desire and other sensations the humans do?(Philosophers call this <i>phenomenal consciousness.</i>) Are they capable of thinking about their experiences? (Philosophers call this <i>self-consciousness.</i>) Do they have beliefs? What about remembering the past? Do earthworms have some form of consciousness? What about salamanders? Is it even possible to study an animal\u2019s inner life? The range of opinion on these questions is nearly as great as the number of possible answers. Tufts University philosopher Daniel C.Dennett declared the state of thinking on animal consciousness a \u201dmess.\u201c</p><p>On the one hand there are the pro-consciousness philosophers like Colin McGinn, a professor at Rutgers University, and Peter Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton and a leading animal rights advocate. These scholars believe that most if not all animals have phenomenal consciousness. \u201cI think it\u2019s a plain common sense that animals have conscious states,\u201d Mr. McGinn said. \u201cAnimals way down to insects have phenomenal consciousness. It\u2019s a primitive feature of the biological world.\u201d</p><p>On the other hand there skeptics like Mr. Dennett and Herbert Terrace, a psychologist at Columbia University. What \u201care you seeing when you are sentience in a creature?\u201dMr. Dennett asked in a 1995 essay. \u201cIt is in fact ridiculously easy to induce powerful intuitions of not just sentience but full-blown consciousness (ripe with malevolence or curiosity or friendship) by exposing people to quite simple robots made to move in familiar mammalian ways at mammalian speeds.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Griffin appears mildly amused by the debate his work has helped unleash. During his visit t the Central Park Zoo he gave a talk to donors and trustees. \u201dDaniel Dennett calls the pursuit of animal consciousness a \u2018wild goose chase,\u2019\u201d he told the audience with a chuckle. \u201cBut there are no neurons or synapses in the human brain that aren\u2019t also in animals. It\u2019s as difficult to disprove animal consciousness as it is to approve it.\u201d</p>", "question": "11.
