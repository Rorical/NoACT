It's a little late to go junking, but I definitely want to open up the store.  I feel surprisingly okay.  I'm looking forward to work. I shave, shower, get dressed, grab a toaster pastry, and head out the door to work</p><p>At work, nothing happens. No one comes in. I just sit there.</p><p>Finally, at about three-o'clock, this guy walks in, not the kind of guy I usually get in here, with an expensive-looking overcoat and a tie.</p><p>\"How much is that old Emerson radio up there?\" he says, pointing to one of the ancient radios that line <span>the ceiling of my shop.</span></p><p><span>\"Those aren't for sale,\" I say. \"None of the radios </span><span>are for sale.\" This is not for any big reason, it's just </span><span>because radios from the Fifties and Sixties are some-</span><span>thing I still like to collect. It's not like they're worth </span><span>that much. These just look kind of neat up there.</span></p><p><span>He looks disappointed, then he says, \"I'll give you </span><span>a hundred for it.\"</span></p><p><span>My heart rises, then I remember its history. Half </span><span>the tubes are missing, the others toasted. I just like </span><span>looking at the things, I'm not really much for fixing </span><span>them up. \"It's really not in working condition,\" I say.</span></p><p><span>\"I don't care. I just want it. One twenty-five?\"</span></p><p><span>The guy's practically pleading with me. Now </span><span>maybe I'm a dope who doesn't know his radios (which </span><span>I am), but I start to think I am looking at someone who </span><span>just really wants this object. I can see it in him. Serious </span><span>collectors always maintain their distance, like they </span><span>couldn't care less if you sell them something. They </span><span>always need to have the upper hand.</span></p><p><span>\"Okay,\" I say to the guy. \"But it doesn't work. Just </span><span>so you know that.\"</span></p><p><span>He's smiling like a maniac by this time. \"It's okay, </span><span>really.\"</span></p><p><span>This is a rare occurrence. No one ever comes in </span><span>here and offers me a lot of money for anything. There </span><span>are plenty of weeks when I don't make one hundred and </span><span>twenty-five dollars. Despite the cash, it makes me feel </span><span>good to see Someone really want Something just for the </span><span>beauty of it.</span></p><p><span>\"Do you collect old radios?\" I say, after I box up </span><span>the Emerson and collect the cash. I'm hoping he </span><span>doesn't tell me that I just sold him a rare prototype </span><span>worth thousands.</span></p><p><span>\"No. My mom and dad had one just like it when l </span><span>was a kid. I've never seen another one like it until </span><span>today.\"</span></p><p><span>This makes me even gladder that I sold it to him. </span><span>This is something I have experienced myself, wanting </span><span>something because it reminded </span><span>me of my c</span><span>hildhood. </span><span>This is a strange thing about people. We own something </span><span>as children, then as adults we are willing to buy it again </span><span>for about a hundred times the original cost. </span><span>We </span><span>think </span><span>we're buying back our youth or our innocence or some-</span><span>thing like that, but what we're really buying back is our </span><span>ignorance.

A narrative that pairs the legend of Mexico's founding by Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god represented by a feathered serpent, with images from the Eurocentric period that began in the New World with the 16th-century Spanish conquest of Mexico, the mural was Orozco's most ambitious venture in the United States. Aside from its grim world view, the Dartmouth fresco reveals Orozco's dual artistic involvement, with Mexico's heritage and with the modern-art movements of the 20th century.</p><p>At the time (1932), Dartmouth's commissioning of a mural by a \"revolutionary\" Mexican artist made waves. There were accusations of extravagance, considered inappropriate during Depression days. (Over two years, the artist received $10,000, including expenses.) There were chauvinistic protests against giving the commission to a foreigner, particularly one of leftist political views. And there were outcries over the strong social commentary in the planned work, as opposed to, say, an amiable depiction of New England scenery. To its credit, Dartmouth rose above these protests, with the help of an art faculty that saw the aesthetic and humanistic strengths of the Mexican mural movement and\u2014not least\u2014with the help of the Rockefeller family, some of whom were alive to the art world's interest in things Mexican.</p><p>After visiting California in 1917-19, Orozco came back to the United States in December 1927. By then recognized in Mexico as a leading mural painter, he sought new patrons for commissions. While in the United States, in addition to the three mural jobs he did win, he produced a good deal of work in other mediums and exhibited a number of earlier pieces done in Mexico: Goyaesque drawings of the Mexican Revolution (in which he served mostly as an observer), political cartoons, vignettes of Mexican life and preparatory drawings for several of his murals back home.</p><p>During his early months in New York, he immersed himself in the city's culture. He signed on with a dealer, Alma Reed, and through her began to frequent the Ashram, a salon steeped in the culture of early Greece. Impressed by New York's vivacity, he made his first lithograph in 1928, <i>Vaudeville</i> <i>in Harlem</i>. A cartoony scene, it is one of some 20 prints done from 1928 to 1930 that achieved commercial and critical success. Other subject matter in the lithographs is grimmer. And some are milder in tone, like <i>Mexican Peasants Working</i> (1929), a sharp sketch of men and women toiling past a giant cactus and rocks in an inhospitable landscape.</p><p>Orozco's take on New York is expressed in a number of oil paintings that deal with urban types, Depression subjects and architecture. They run from <i>Elevated</i> (1929-30), a powerful abstract impression of rising girders and structural supports, to <i>Successful People </i>(1931), a cartoonish study of a very snooty couple, perhaps at the opera. The latter demonstrates Orozco's considerable gift for caricature, which he often decried but was not above using in his murals.</p><p>The first of Orozco's work to draw real critical attention, however, was that dealing with the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910 and lasted through 1917. The more than 40 ink-and-graphite war drawings, done from memory beginning in 1926, were attempts to integrate the large revolutionary themes of his murals with the informality of his political caricatures. Emphasizing the conflict among social classes, they depict bodies strewn on battlefields, soldiers marching, the victims of a dynamited train, a group solemnly participating in a requiem vigil.</p><p>After his return to Mexico in June 1934, Orozco is said to have done some of his finest work.

Dr. Buratti worked on the project with Lane Johnson, then a student at Pomona College; the two published their findings in the astronomical journal <i>Icarus</i>.</p><p>At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dr.  Buratti served on the science team for the Clementine spacecraft, which thoroughly photographed the Moon in 1994. As part of that work, she and others had looked for evidence of transient phenomena like asteroid impacts and had found none. Just as they were preparing a paper on their research, a colleague mentioned what is known as Stuart's event.</p><p>\"I had never heard of it,\" Dr. Buratti said. But her curiosity was piqued, so she found a 1956 copy of the amateur journal The Strolling Astronomer and looked at the photo.</p><p>She and Johnson were able to determine the approximate location of the flash, a circular area with a radius of about 20 miles.  From. the brightness of the event, they estimated the force of the impact to be about half a megaton, equal to a small hydrogen bomb. Their best guess as to the size of a feature created by such an impact, including a crater and its ejecta blanket, the material thrown out around the sides, was 1.2 miles or less-too small to see from ground-based photographs.</p><p>So first they looked at photographs taken by the lunar orbiters in the 1960s, which mapped areas of the Moon to prepare for the Apollo landings.

It also happened to be in the exact center of the area they were looking. And it was the proper size-slightly less than a mile across, including the ejecta blanket. Dr. Buratti estimated the size of the asteroid at 20 yards in diameter.</p><p>She said that although there was a good deal of uncertainty in their study, she was \"about 90 percent\" confident that the crater was the one created by the fireball Dr. Stuart observed. \"There's no other object that stands out as a candidate,\" she said.</p><p>Dr. Stuart, who died in the 1960s, was not one to make wild claims. \"He was very careful to eliminate all the other possibilities,\" she said. \"At the time, scientists didn't even agree that craters were caused by impacts.
