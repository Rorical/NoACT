The butterflies first store lipids before they begin their migration. During migration, as stored lipids are converted to energy, lipid mass continuously decreases. When the butterflies reach the overwintering sites, ending their migration, they must store lipids again before beginning the overwintering period.</p><p><i>Hypothesis 2</i> </p><p>Monarch butterflies require energy from stored lipids for migration but not during the overwintering period. The butterflies store lipids before they begin their migration. During migration, as stored lipids are converted to energy, lipid mass continuously decreases. Because energy from stored lipids is not required during the overwintering period, the butterflies do not store lipids while at the overwintering sites.</p><p><i>Hypothesis 3</i> </p><p>Monarch butterflies require energy from stored lipids during the overwintering period but not for migration. The butterflies do not store lipids before they begin their migration.
