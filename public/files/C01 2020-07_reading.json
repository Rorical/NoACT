This produced a frenzy of harvesting on the Kennebec, Penobscot and Sheepscot Rivers, and two thousand cargoes of ice packed in hay and sawdust were shipped south to New York, Philadelphia, and other more southern cities, where they were sold for a total of around S1.5 million.</p><p>Though the demand for ice rose annually, the New York suppliers did not explore the use of artificial refrigeration. Instead, they began to buy up sections of the Kennebec River shoreline and to erect great wooden warehouses there, transforming the landscape of the river for many miles. It was the same farther inland, where ice companies bought up shoreline along the lakes and put up storehouses to supply the meat industry of Chicago and the brewers of Milwaukee, as well as millions of domestic consumers.</p><p>The first real crisis in the natural-ice trade was caused not by competition from artificial manufacture, but by pollution. As the cities grew, they encroached on the rivers and lakes from which the ice was cut, and soon there were health scares. This produced a search for cleaner supplies away from towns, and stimulated the search for a means of manufacturing ice with pure water. The realization that the bacteria that cause diseases such as typhoid were not killed off in frozen water added to the urgency of finding safer forms of refrigeration.</p><p>The natural-ice trade began to decline from the early decades of the twentieth century, though in more remote areas of North America where electric power was not available but lake ice was abundant in winter, it survived as late as the 1950s. As ice harvesting died out, the evidence of its former vast scale rapidly disappeared. There was no alternative use for the great ice-houses, many of which simply burned down, often set alight by a spark from a steam train-they were surprisingly flammable, as most were made of wood and kept as dry as possible to better preserve the blocks of ice they housed. But the majority were demolished or simply rotted away.</p><p>Over a wide area of the northern states, young diving enthusiasts with no knowledge of the former ice trade still emerge from lakes and rivers clutching an impressive variety of odd implements-plows and chisels and scrapers that fell through the ice during the harvesting. One or two museums keep small displays of these tools, and collectors have preserved manufacturers\u2019 catalogs that proudly present their versions of the ice plow, the ice saw, the grapple, the Jack grapple, the breaking-off bar, the caulk bar, the packing chisel, the house bar, the fork bar, the float hook, the line marker, and many other specialist implements the of which has long been forgotten.</p><p>The inner-city icehouses have also gone. and the ice wagon and the iceman are rapidly fading memories. All that is left in America of this once-great industry is the water itself, which provided a continuously renewable supply of ice each winter. There are few memorials on the banks of the rivers and lakes that once produced such a vital crop.</p>", "question": "20.

That the proportion of carbon governs the hardness was first noted in 1774 by the Swedish metallurgist Torbern Bergmann, who was by any standards a scientist, teaching chemistry, physics and mathematics at Uppsala. Bergmann made an extensive study of the propensity of different chemical elements to combine with one another-a property known as elective affinity, central to the eighteenth-century notion of chemical reactivity.

It offered a way of removing impurities from pig iron and adjusting its carbon content during conversion to steel. A blast of air through the molten metal turned impurities such as silicon into light silica slag (a collection of compounds removed from metal in the smelting process), and removed carbon in the form of volatile carbon dioxide. Pig iron contains as much as 4 per cent carbon; steels have only around 0.3-2 per cent.

A dash of the metal manganese helps to remove oxygen and sulphur from the iron, and most of the manganese currently produced globally is used for this purpose. Manganese also makes steel stronger, while nickel and chromium improve its hardness, And chromium is the key additive in stainless steel-in a proportion of more than about 11 per cent, it makes the metal rust-resistant. Most modern steels are therefore alloys blended to give the desired properties.</p><p>But is this science? Some of the early innovations in steel alloys were chance discoveries, often due to impurities incorporated by accident. In this respect, metallurgy has long retained the air of an artisan craft, akin to the trial-and-error explorations of dyers, glass-makers and potters. But the reason for this empiricism is not that the science of metallurgy is trivial: it is because it is so difficult. According to Rodney Cotterill, a remarkable British physicist whose expertise stretched from the sciences of materials to that of the brain, 'metallurgy is one of our most ancient arts but is often referred to as one of the youngest sciences</p><p>One of the principal difficulties in understanding the behaviour of materials such as steel is that this depends on its structure over a wide range of length scales, from the packing of individual atoms to the size and shape of grains micrometres or even millimetres in size. Science has trouble dealing with such a span of scales. One might regard this difficulty as akin to that in the social sciences, where social behaviour is governed by how individuals behave but also how we interact on the scale of families and neighbourhoods, within entire cities, and at a national level. (That's why the social sciences are arguably among the hardest of sciences too.)</p><p>The mechanical properties of metals depend on how flaws in the crystal structure, called defects, move and interact. These defects are produced by almost inevitable imperfections in the regular stacking of atoms in the crystalline material. The most common type of stacking fault is called a dislocation: Metals bend, rather than shattering like porcelain, because dislocations can shift around and accommodate the deformation. But if dislocations accumulate and get entangled, restricting their ability to move, the metal becomes brittle. This is what happens after repeated deformation, causing the cracking known as metal fatigue. Dislocations can also get trapped at the boundaries between the fine, microscopic grains that divide a metal into mosaics of crystallites. The arrest of dislocations at grain edges means that metals may be made <span>harder by reducing the size of their grains, a useful trick for modifying their mechanical behaviour.</span></p>", "question": "31.

This was why Henry Bessemer's new process for making steel was greeted with jubilation: the details, announced at a meeting of the British Association in 1856, were published in full in <i>The Times</i>. Bessemer himself was lauded not just as an engineer but as a scientist, being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1879.</p><p>Bessemer's process controlled the amount of carbon mixed with iron to make steel. That the proportion of carbon governs the hardness was first noted in 1774 by the Swedish metallurgist Torbern Bergmann, who was by any standards a scientist, teaching chemistry, physics and mathematics at Uppsala. Bergmann made an extensive study of the propensity of different chemical elements to combine with one another-a property known as elective affinity, central to the eighteenth-century notion of chemical reactivity. He was a mentor and sponsor of Carl Wilhelm Scheele, the greatest Swedish chemist of the age and co-discoverer of oxygen.</p><p>Oxygen, as a component of air, was the key to the Bessemer process. It offered a way of removing impurities from pig iron and adjusting its carbon content during conversion to steel. A blast of air through the molten metal turned impurities such as silicon into light silica slag (a collection of compounds removed from metal in the smelting process), and removed carbon in the form of volatile carbon dioxide. Pig iron contains as much as 4 per cent carbon; steels have only around 0.3-2 per cent. Meanwhile, the heat produced in these reactions with oxygen kept the iron molten without the need for extra fuel.</p><p>It was long known that steel can be improved with a spice of other elements. A dash of the metal manganese helps to remove oxygen and sulphur from the iron, and most of the manganese currently produced globally is used for this purpose. Manganese also makes steel stronger, while nickel and chromium improve its hardness, And chromium is the key additive in stainless steel-in a proportion of more than about 11 per cent, it makes the metal rust-resistant. Most modern steels are therefore alloys blended to give the desired properties.</p><p>But is this science? Some of the early innovations in steel alloys were chance discoveries, often due to impurities incorporated by accident. In this respect, metallurgy has long retained the air of an artisan craft, akin to the trial-and-error explorations of dyers, glass-makers and potters.
