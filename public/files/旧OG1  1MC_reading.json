Fran is the narrator of the story.<br/><br/>Mother, who wanted to keep her, always thought of her as some wild little bird, but I knew she was a homing pigeon. I knew that at some point in her flight path, sooner or later, she would make a U-turn. A sort of human boomerang. So even though I had long since stopped expecting it, I was not surprised when I walked down the gravel drive to the mailbox, which I\u2019d painted papaya yellow to attract good news, and found the flimsy envelope with the Dallas postmark. I didn\u2019t know a soul in Dallas postmark, or Texas for that matter, but the handwriting reminded me of someone\u2019s. My own.<br/><br/>I walked back inside the house.<br/><br/>\"Still raining?\" Mother asked. She was sitting in her new electric wheelchair in front of the TV, painting her fingernails a neon violet.  <br/><br/>\"Just let up,\" I said. \"Sun\u2019s poking through. You know anyone in Dallas, Mother?\"<br/><br/>\"Not so as I recall.\" She dabbed at her pinky with a cottonball. Mother was vain about her hands. I was used to how she looked now, but I noticed people staring in the doctor\u2019s waiting room. She had lost some weight and most of her hair to chemotherapy, and I guess people were startled to see these dragon-lady nails on a woman who looked as if she should be lying in satin with some flowers on her chest.<br/><br/>\"Why do you ask?\" she said.<br/><br/>I opened the envelope and a picture fluttered into my lap. It was a Polaroid of a sweet-faced blond holding a newborn baby in a blue blanket. Before I even read the letter I knew. I knew how those Nazis feel when suddenly, after twenty or thirty uneventful years, they are arrested walking down some sunny street in Buenos Aires. It\u2019s the shock of being found after waiting so long.<br/><br/>\"What\u2019s that?\" Mother said.<br/><br/>I wheeled her around to face me and handed her the Polaroid. She studied it for a minute and then looked up, speechless for once, waiting for me to set the tone.<br/><br/>\"That\u2019s her,\" I said. \"Her name\u2019s Linda Rose Caswell.\"<br/><br/>We looked at the picture again. The blind woman was seated on a flowered couch, her wavy hair just grazing the edge of a dime-a-dozen seascape in a cheap gilt frame.<br/><br/>Mother pointed to the envelope, \"What\u2019s she say?\"<br/><br/>I unfolded the letter, a single page neatly written.<br/><br/>\"She says she\u2019s had my name and address for some time but wanted to wait to contact me until after the birth. The baby\u2019s name is Blake and he weighs eight pounds, eight ounces, and was born by cesarean. She says they are waiting and hoping to hear back from me soon.\"<br/><br/>\"That\u2019s it?\"<br/><br/>I nodded and handed her the letter. It was short and businesslike, but I could see the ghosts of all the long letters she must have written and crumpled into the wastebasket.<br/><br/>\"I guess that makes you a great-grandmother,\" I said.<br/><br/>\"What about you?\" She snorted, pointing a Jungle Orchid fingernail at me. \"You\u2019re a grandmother.\"<br/><br/>We shook our heads in disbelief. I sat silently, listening to my brain catch up with my history. Forty years old and I felt as if I had just shaken hands with Death. I suppose it\u2019s difficult for any woman to accept that she\u2019s a grandmother, but in the normal order of things, you have ample time to adjust to the idea. You don\u2019t get a snapshot in the mail one day from a baby girl you gave up twenty-four years ago saying, \"Congratulations, you\u2019re a grandma!\"<br/><br/>\"It\u2019s not fair,\u201d I said, \"I don\u2019t even feel like a <i>mother</i>.\u201d<br/><br/>\"Well, here\u2019s the living proof.\" Mother tapped her nail against the glossy picture. \"She looks just like you. Only her nose aristocratic\"<br/><br/>\"I am going to work.\" My knees cracked when I stood up. \"You be all right here?\"<br/><br/>Mother nodded, scrutinizing the picture in her lap, \"You going to write to her?\"<br/><br/>\u201cOf course I am,\" I bristled, \"I may be some things, but I am not rude.\"<br/><br/>\"You going to invite them here? Her and the baby?\" She swiveled her eyes sideways at me.<br/><br/>\"I haven\u2019t thought that far,\" I said.<br/><br/>\"Well, don\u2019t put it off.\" She slid her eyes back to the television. \"She\u2019s been waiting twenty-five years. You worried she\u2019s going to be trouble or ask for money? For all we know, She\u2019s married to a brain surgeon with his and her Cadillacs.\"<br/><br/>\"She didn\u2019t mention any husband at all\", I said, getting drawn into it despite myself.<br/><br/>\"Maybe you\u2019re worried she\u2019ll be disappointed in you,\" she said, \"You know, that she\u2019s had this big fantasy for all these years that maybe you were Grace Kelly or Margaret Mead and who could live up to that? No one. But you don\u2019t have to, Fran, that\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re her flesh-and-blood mother and that\u2019s enough. That\u2019s all it\u2019ll take.\"</p>", "question": "1.

Her and the baby?\" She swiveled her eyes sideways at me.<br/><br/>\"I haven\u2019t thought that far,\" I said.<br/><br/>\"Well, don\u2019t put it off.\" She slid her eyes back to the television. \"She\u2019s been waiting twenty-five years. You worried she\u2019s going to be trouble or ask for money? For all we know, She\u2019s married to a brain surgeon with his and her Cadillacs.\"<br/><br/>\"She didn\u2019t mention any husband at all\", I said, getting drawn into it despite myself.<br/><br/>\"Maybe you\u2019re worried she\u2019ll be disappointed in you,\" she said, \"You know, that she\u2019s had this big fantasy for all these years that maybe you were Grace Kelly or Margaret Mead and who could live up to that?

I was born into a city that feared its future, and trained me for emigration. I attended a school run by Irish nuns, who regarded our walled-off school compound in Calcutta as a corner of England. My \u201ccounty\u201d\u2014called in Bengali <i>desh</i>\u2014I have never seen. It is the ancestral home of my father and is now in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, I speak his dialect of Bengali, and think of myself as \u201cbelonging\u201d to Faridpur, the tiny village that was his birthplace. The larger political entity to which I have my first allegiance\u2014India\u2014was not even a sovereign nation when I was born.</p><p><br/></p>My horoscope, cast by a neighborhood astrologer when I was a week-old infant, predicted that I would be a writer, that I would cross oceans and make my home among aliens. Brought up in a culture that places its faith in horoscopes, it never occurred to me to doubt it. The astrologer meant to offer me a melancholy future, to be destined to leave India was to be banished from the sources of true culture. The nuns at school, on the other hand, insinuated that India had long outlived its glories, and that if we wanted to be educated, modern women, we\u2019d better hit the trail westward. All my girlhood, I straddled the seesaw of contradictions.<br/><br/>I have found my to the United States after many transit stops. The unglimpsed phantom Faridpur and the all too real Manhattan have merged as \u201cdesh.\u201d I am an American. I am an American writer, in the American mainstream, trying to extend it. This is a vitally important statement for me\u2014I am not an Indian writer, not an expatriate. I am an immigrant; my investment is in the American reality, not the Indian.<p><br/></p>It took me ten painful years, from the early seventies to the early eighties, to overthrow the smothering tyranny of nostalgia. The remaining struggle for me is to make the American readership, meaning the editorial and publishing industries as well, acknowledge the same fact. The foreign-born, the Third World immigrant with non-Western religions and non-European languages and appearance, can be as American as any steerage passenger from Ireland, Italy, or the Russian Pale.<br/><br/>My literary agenda begins by acknowledging that American has transformed <i>me</i>. It does not end until I show how I(and the hundreds of thousands like me) have transformed America.<p><br/></p>I\u2019ve had to sensitize editors as well as readers to the richness of the lives I\u2019m the writing about. The most moving form of praise I receive from readers can be summed up in three words: <i>I never knew</i>. Meaning, I see these people (call them Indians, Filipinos, Koreans, Chinese) around me all the time and I never knew they had an inner life. I never knew they schemed and cheated, suffered, cared so rudimentary, the writer knows she has an inexhaustible fictional population to enumerate. Perhaps even a mission.<br/><br/>I have been blessed with an enormity of material: the rapid and dramatic transformation of the United States since the early 1970s. With that perceived perimeter, however, I hope to wring surprise.<br/><br/>Yet my imaginative home is also in the tales told by my mother and grandmother, the world of the Hindu epics. For all the hope and energy I have placed in the process of immigration and accommodation\u2014I\u2019m a person who couldn\u2019t ride a public bus when she first arrived, and now I\u2019m someone who watches tractor pulls on obscure cable channels\u2014there are parts of me that remain Indian. The form that my stories and novels take inevitably reflects the resources of Indian mythology\u2014shape-changing, miracles, godly perspectives. My character can, I hope, transcend the straitjacket of simple psychologizing. The people I write about <b class=\"now\">are culturally and politically several hundred years old</b>: consider the history they have witnessed (colonialism, technology, education, liberation, civil war). They have shed old identities, taken on new ones, and learned to hide the scars. They may sell you newspapers, or clean your offices at night.<p><br/></p>Writers (especially American writers weaned on affluence and freedom) often disavow the notion of a \u201cliterary duty\u201d or \u201cpolitical consciousness,\u201d citing the all-too-frequent examples of writers ruined by their shrill commitments.
