Worried on several counts, the most immediate being a civic responsibility he was scheduled to discuss at an  emergency meeting this Friday, the fourteenth of October; a meeting he had requested. </p><p>Joe Crown seldom revealed inner anxieties, and that was the case as he worked in his office this morning. He was a picture of steadiness, rectitude,  prosperity. He wore a fine suit of medium gray enlivened by a dark red four-in-hand tied under a high collar. Since the day was not yet too warm, he kept his coat on. </p><p>Joe\u2019s hair was more silver than white. He washed it daily, kept it shining. His eyes behind spectacles with  silver wire frames were dark brown, rather large, and alert. His mustache and imperial showed careful attention; he had an appointment at twelve for the weekly trim. His hands were small but strong. He wasn\u2019t handsome, but he was commanding. </p><p>Three principles ruled Joe Crown\u2019s business and personal life, of which the most important was order. In German,  <i>Ordnung</i>. Without order, organization, some rational plan, you had chaos. </p><p>The second principle was accuracy. Accuracy was  mandatory in brewing, where timing and temperatures were critical. But accuracy was also the keystone of any business that made money instead of losing it. The primary tool for achieving accuracy was mathematics. Joe Crown had a towering belief in the potency of correct  information, and the absolute authority of numbers which provided it. </p><p>In Germany, he\u2019d learned his numbers before he learned to read. Though a mediocre student in most school subjects, at ciphering he was a prodigy. He  could add a column of figures, or do calculations in his head, with astonishing speed. In Cincinnati, his first stop in America, he\u2019d begged the owner of a Chinese laundry to teach him to use an abacus. One of these ancient counting devices could be found in his office,  sitting on a low cabinet, within reach. Money measured success; counting measured money. </p><p>Questions he asked of his employees often involved numbers. \u201cWhat is the exact temperature?\u201d \u201cHow large is the population in that market?\u201d  \u201cHow  many barrels did we ship last week?\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s the cost, per square foot, of this expansion?\u201d </p><p>As for his third principle, modernity, he believed that, too, was crucial in business. Men who said the old ways were the best ways were fools, doomed to fall  behind and fail. Joe was always searching for the newest methods to improve the brewery\u2019s product, output, efficiency, cleanliness. He hadn\u2019t hesitated to install expensive pasteurization equipment when he opened his first small brewery in Chicago. He\u2019d been  among the first to invest heavily in refrigerated freight cars. He insisted that modern machines be used in the office.

The telescope would have to be mounted in an enormous wooden gantry, capable of being turned safely on its axis by just two workmen, but also susceptible to the finest fingertip adjustments by the observing astronomer. </p><p>The forty-foot would be higher than a house. The astronomer (William) would be required to climb a series of ladders to a special viewing platform perched at the mouth of the telescope. The assistant (William\u2019s sister, Caroline) would have to be shut in a special booth below to avoid light pollution, where she would have her desk and lamp, celestial clocks, and observation journals. Astronomer and assistant would be invisible to each other for hours on end, shouting commands and replies, although eventually connected by a metal speaking-tube. </p><p>William had decided that his grand project required a new house with larger grounds for constructing and erecting the telescope. On 3 April 1786 they moved to 'The Grove', a quite small and rather dilapidated country house on the edge of the tiny village of Slough, England. </p><p>The house itself was not large, but it had sheds and stables which were gradually converted into workshops and laboratories. Above the stables were a series of haylofts which could be converted into a separate apartment. Caroline claimed these for her own. A small outside staircase led up to a flat roof from which she hoped to carry out her comet \u2018sweeps, in security and independently. She would check over the calculations of William\u2019s nebulae by day, and make her own sweeps up on the roof by night. </p><p>William had built Caroline a special two-foot Newtonian reflector. Because of its large aperture, its tube appeared much fatter, heavier and stubbier than normal reflectors of this type. Suspended from a pivot  at the top of the box-frame, the telescope could be precisely raised or lowered by a system of pulleys operated by a winding handle. These adjustments were easy to make, and extremely fine. </p><p>This beautiful instrument was designed specifically for its huge light-gathering power and its wide angle of vision. The magnification was comparatively low at twenty-four times. As with modern binoculars, this combination of low power with a large viewing field allowed the observer to see faint stellar objects very brightly, while placing them within a comparatively wide context of surrounding stars. The telescope was perfectly designed to spot any strange or unknown object moving through the familiar field of \u2018fixed stars\u2019. In other words,, to catch new planets or new comets. </p><p>On 1 August 1786, only two nights after starting her new sweeps, Caroline thought she had spotted an unknown stellar object moving through Ursa Major (the Great Bear constellation). It appeared to be descending, but barely perceptibly, towards a triangulation of stars in the beautifully named constellation Coma Berenices. To find something so quickly, and in such a familiar place (the Great Bear or Big Dipper being the first stop of every amateur stargazer wanting to locate the Pole Star), seemed wildly unlikely. Caroline\u2019s Observation Book conveys meticulous caution, but also remarkable certainty. </p><p>Unable to calculate the mathematical coordinates of the object, she accompanied her observations with a series of three neat drawings or \u2018figures\u2019, over an eighty-minute time lapse. These showed the circular viewing field of her telescope, with an asterisk shape very slightly changing position relative to three known fixed stars. The account written into her \u2018Book of Work Done, catches something of her growing excitement. </p><p>August 1st. I have calculated 100 nebulae today, and this evening I saw an object which I believe will prove tomorrow night to be a Comet. August 2nd. 1 o\u2019clock. the object of last night IS A COMET. August 3rd. I did not go to rest till I had written to Dr Blagden [at the Royal Society] and Mr Aubert to announce the Comet. </p><p>The verification of Caroline\u2019s comet was achieved much more rapidly than William\u2019s discovery of the planet Uranus had been. Its movement through Coma Berenices was relatively easy to ascertain, and its fine hazy tail or coma was unmistakable.</p>", "question": "11.

In the flesh, neither Mama nor I were serving anything but the unaesthetic spill of everyday thought and feeling that routinely floods us all, only a select part of which, in this case, invoked the principals in a tale of psychological embroilment that had as its protagonist neither me nor my mother but rather our \u201cfierce attachment.\u201d </p><p>At the heart of my memoir lay a revelation: I could not leave my mother because I had become my mother. This complicated insight was my bit of wisdom, the history I wanted badly to trace out. The context in which the book is set\u2014our life in the Bronx in the 1950s, alternating with walks taken in Manhattan in the 1980s\u2014was the situation; the story was the insight. What mattered most to me was not the literalness of the situation, but the emotional truth of the story. What actually happened is only raw material; what matters is what the memoirist makes of what happened. </p><p>Memoirs belong to the category of literature, not of journalism. It is a misunderstanding to read a memoir as though the writer owes the reader the same record of literal accuracy that is owed in newspaper reporting or historical narrative. What is owed the reader is the ability to persuade that the narrator is trying, as honestly as possible, to get to the bottom of the tale at hand. </p><p><br/></p><p>Passage B by Jacqueline Tavenier-Courbin </p><p>The dividing line between fiction and autobiography is often a very fine and shaky one, and Ernest Hemingway\u2019s autobiography of the artist as a young man is a case in point. As nearly all readers know, Hemingway\u2019s fiction contains numerous autobiographical elements, and his protagonists are often conscious projections and explorations of the self. At the same time, Hemingway\u2019s openly autobiographical writings,  <i>Green Hills of Africa</i> and  <i>A Moveable Feast</i>, are barely more autobiographical than his fiction, and, in many ways, just as fictional. </p><p><i>A Moveable Feast</i> is particularly complex because Hemingway was clearly conscious that it would be his literary testament. Thus, in writing it, he dealt with issues which had been important to him and he settled old scores. Among the reasons which motivated his portrayal of self and others were the need to justify himself, for he felt that he had been unfairly portrayed by some of his contemporaries, the desire to present his own version of personal relationships as well as the desire to get back at people against whom he held a grudge, the need to relive his youth in an idealized fashion, and the wish to leave to the world a flattering self-portrait. Thus,  <i>A Moveable Feast</i> could hardly be an objective portrayal of its author and his contemporaries, and the accuracy of the anecdotes becomes an issue that can never be entirely resolved. </p><p>While it is impossible to verify everything Hemingway wrote in  <i>A Moveable Feast</i>, one might conclude that he invented and lied relatively seldom about pure facts. When he did so, it was usually in order to reinforce the pattern he had created\u2014i.e., a negative portrayal of literary competitors and an idealized self-portrayal. He clearly overlooked a great deal of material, distorted some, and generally selected the episodes so that they would show him as innocent, honest, dedicated, and thoroughly enjoying life.  <i>A Moveable Feast</i>, in fact, appears as a fascinating composite of relative factual accuracy and clear dishonesty of intent.</p>", "question": "30.
