The idea of establishing a country's \"proverbial minimum\" began in Russia in the 1970s, when scholars identified about 300 proverbs that every Russian knows.

On one level, they reduce proverbs to simple formulas, like \u201cWhere there's X, ihere's Y.\u201d But on a deeper level, where they use symbolic logic, their results are pages full of pluses, minuses, equal signs and does-not-equal signs.</p>", "question": "11.

Its root logic, though, is simple enough: If life was brewed on the planet Earth in a primordial soup of chemicals 4 billion to 4.5 billion years ago, why shouldn't it have happened on at least one other planet in the universe, too? Astronomers calculate that hundreds of millions of Earth-like planets must exist throughout the universe.</p><p>Early space exploration didn't turn up life. When NASA's Viking landers examined Mars two decades ago, they found a dry, sterile environment. Venus was a blazing inferno. It was only the images from the Galileo spacecraft that raised a slight hope of finding suitable conditions for life elsewhere in our solar system: Jupiter's moon Europa appeared to have an ocean of liquid water covered with pack ice.</p><p>Scientists who are skeptical about life's having arisen elsewhere have had a strong case, given the precise conditions that seemed essential for life to develop and survive. Planets that are too small cannot retain an atmosphere at all. Those too large turn into gas balls, like Jupiter. Those that are too hot or too cold have no liquid water. And without water, the chemical process of photosynthesis, which converts sunlight into chemical energy, is impossible. Without an atmosphere of oxygen, the chemical reactions that allow a cell to extract energy from other chemicals cannot normally run, either.</p><p>But recent findings from our own planet have led scientists to wonder if they've taken too parochial a view of life. Microbes have been discovered thriving under circumstances once thought impossible: in volcanic vents, in hot springs, in geysers. Antarctica's rocks, the cold waters deep beneath the surface of its frozen lakes, and the subterranean ground water below the basalt flows of Washington State's Columbia River Basin may harbor terrestrial models for the rise of life on Mars and other planets. And some tantalizing, if still highly controversial, evidence from Mars at least hints that some similar forms of life may indeed have arisen there, even if they subsequently died out. A Martian meteorite found in Antarctica contains microscopic wormlike structures, dating from at least 3.6 billion 45 years ago, that resemble fossilized bacterial forms found on Earth.</p><p>The earthly microbes that seem to defy the odds are members of a category loosely called \"extremophiles.\" Among their hardy ranks are the thermophiles, which thrive in searing heat; the halophiles, which love salt; and the barophiles, bacteria often found in the deep sea that live under high pressure.</p><p>Evidence of life in inhospitable environments began to pile up in recent years as highly sensitive gene-sequencing techniques made it possible to identify microorganisms that wouldn't grow in petri dishes in the lab.
