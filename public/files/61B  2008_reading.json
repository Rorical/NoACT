The wax forms in scales and slides out from the underside of her abdomen. In the warmer months, when the population of the hive swells, the wax-producing bees begin to build layers of new comb. They gorge themselves on honey and secrete Immense quantities of wax(consuming six to eight pounds of honey to produce one pound of wax). Workers roll the wax up away from their abdomens with their legs, and chew and soften it with saliva. With their mouths and feet they manipulate the wax to form the mathematically precise sheets of fragile hexagonal cells that honey bees have routinely created for millions of years.</p><p>In the second stage of life (between ten and twenty days old) worker bees go to the entrance of the hive and receive in their mouths the nectar that older foragers have brought back in their honey stomachs. A forager may visit hundreds of sources of nectar (for example, each of the florets on a head of clover) to fill her honey <span>stomach\u2014a kind of holding tank\u2014just once. Every teaspoon of honey may require thousands of trips to the field by forager bees.</span></p><p><span>The receiving bee holds the nectar in her honey stomach as she carries it up to the cells where the honey is stored. When she disgorges the nectar she adds to it fluids secreted from her salivary and now contracted hypopharyngeal glands, filled with enzymes to purify and preserve the honey. The receiving bees pack the nectar into honey cells. Other workers stand above, thrumming their wings to evaporate excess moisture and thicken the nectar.</span></p><p><span>The bees now begin to make their first excursion</span><span> outside, short flights to familiarize themselves with the territory. Some are responsible for clearing refuse from the hive; they carry the corpses of other bees a distance from the hive and drop them to the ground. Others guard the entrance to the hive; they use their stingers to attack intruders, including honey-stealing bees from other hives.</span></p><p><span>In the final period of a worker bee's life, from about the twentieth day until her death, she becomes a forager, collecting water, resin, nectar, or pollen. Her body is ingeniously shaped for the work. Her inner back legs are covered with bristly brushes that mesh together on opposite legs. The bee brushes away pollen from a flower's thickly coated stamens, then forces the pollen through the stiff hairs of one leg with the bristles of the leg opposite, as though combing or sifting it. On the outer side of her back legs are deep indentations called pollen baskets. She moistens the pollen with honey that she has brought from the hive in her honey stomach. She forms the pollen into a ball, like bread dough, packs it into her pollen baskets, then flies back to the hive with bright bulbs of pollen bulging from her legs.</span></p>", "question": "40.
