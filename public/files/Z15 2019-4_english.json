It plunges six arms and its body into the sand, <b>displays</b> a banded black-and-white color pattern, and waves the two free arms in opposite directions. The gesture appears quite effective in warding off an attack.<br/></p><p>As yet, scientists have minimal video footage of the mimic octopus, and the momentary glimpses afforded by still photos <b>offered</b> inconclusive evidence for claims about the extent of the octopus\u2019s capabilities.
