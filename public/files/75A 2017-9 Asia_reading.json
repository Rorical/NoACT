The thing he was cautioning me about that day was the big radio-record player combo that had sat on a black wire stand in the living room, and now\u2014 mysteriously, wonderfully\u2014sat in my room. That was the year we finally got a TV. I suppose they gave the radio to me to get it out of the living room. </p><p>One especially vehement warning that Dad gave was to avoid \"that longhair music.'' But the longhair music\u2014whatever it was\u2014was included in the records he passed on to me, so I realized this was not a strict prohibition, but rather a word to the wise, which implied that I was now old enough to understand such matters. There was certainly enough music to play without resorting to the longhair albums. What were the consequences of listening? I was not yet a rebellious child. I wanted things to be as they were presented. </p><p>During the day, when my parents were around, I played the jazzy records, often choosing ones they liked so that they would approve of my taste. Sometimes at night, though, I'd pull the wire stand over to my bed and turn the radio on very low. At the start, I listened to the first station I happened to tune in to; later I began turning the knob ever so slowly, starting as far to the right as it would go and moving steadily left. I wanted to hear everything. </p><p>One rainy night a station came in where there had been none before. The announcer's voice sounded a little pompous and long-winded, like on those stations where all they did was talk, and I was about to ease the knob away when the music began. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t a song; it was much too long for that. It was\u2014I couldn't describe it. Glorious. Complicated. Liberating. A challenge, a discovery, something you had to listen to, not merely hear. I dropped out of bed and sat on the floor with my ear pressed against the speaker. There was always the danger that my mother or father would come in and ask me why I was out of bed, but I didn't care. </p><p>When the music came to an end, the announcer said the station was CBC in Toronto. I had never been to Toronto, but I wondered why they should have such splendor when we did not. He must have said the name of the piece, too. but I had no context in which to understand it.
