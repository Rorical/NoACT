Olivine and pyroxenes are the most abundant minerals in mantle rocks and in the lavas erupted at HSVs. The lavas at HSVs also retain a lot of water from the mantle. By weight, water vapor accounts for 75% of the total gas output at HSVs, while CO<sub>2</sub> accounts for only 10%-15%. All other gases combined never account for more than 10%-15% of the total gas output. Kilauea Caldera, in Hawaii, erupts this way.</p><p><i>Scientist 2</i></p><p>In certain places near the top of the mantle, at depths of less than 100 km, a high concentration of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> allows mantle rocks to melt at lower temperatures than they normally would. This is how the magma that fuels an HSV forms. The magma then rises toward Earth's surface in small isolated bodies that melt through the entire thickness of the crust, sometimes causing small fractures (less than 1 km long) in crustal rocks. Each eruption at an HSV depletes some of the excess CO<sub>2</sub>, which is why eruption frequency at an HSV will typically slow down over time.</p><p>HSVs erupt lavas in which feldspar is the most abundant mineral. These aluminum-rich lavas contain much less water than most mantle rocks. By weight, CO<sub>2 </sub>and water vapor each account for 45% of the total gas output at HSVs. Carbon monoxide (CO) accounts for 6% of the total gas output, and all other gases combined account for only 4%. Mt. Erebus, in Antarctica, erupts this way.</p>", "question": "33.
