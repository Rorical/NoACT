Lease accepted the invitation and, during that year, delivered over 160 speeches for the party. </p><p>A shrewd speaker, Lease presented complex issues, such <b>as interest rates, in a confident, straightforward,</b> manner that her audiences <b>understand easier.</b> She denounced big business and bank owners <b>who,</b> she believed, created disadvantages for farmers and workers by monopolizing wealth. Lease used <b>genuinely accurate</b> language to extol the Populist Party\u2019s call for election reforms, minimum wage laws, and a redistribution of wealth. Lease also ridiculed her opposition and presented the Populist Party as both the logical and morally correct choice. <b>Thus it was that critics</b> and supporters alike <b>admired her</b> ability to energize audiences. One critic even noted, <b>\u201cShe could recite the multiplication table and set a crowd hooting and harrahing at her will.\u201d </b></p><p>Such positive responses to Lease\u2019s compelling speeches gave the Populist Party the momentum it needed.
