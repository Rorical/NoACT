Almost every other major shopping </span><span>center had been built on a single level, which made for </span><span>punishingly long walks. Gruen put stores on two levels, </span><span>connected by escalators and fed by two-tiered parking. </span><span>In the middle he put a kind of town square, a \"garden </span><span>court\" under a skylight, with a fishpond, enormous </span><span>sculpted trees, a twenty-one-foot cage filled with </span><span>bright-colored birds, balconies with hanging plants, and </span><span>a caf\u00e9.</span></p><p><span>Southdale Mall still exists. It does not seem like a </span><span>historic building, which is precisely why it is one. </span><span>Victor Gruen didn't design a building; he designed an </span><span>archetype. Victor Gruen may well have been the most </span><span>influential architect of the twentieth century. He </span><span>invented the mall.</span></p><p><span>Planning and control were of great importance to </span><span>Gruen. In the middle of the nineteenth century, Vienna </span><span>had demolished the walls and other fortifications that </span><span>had ringed the city since medieval times, and in the </span><span>resulting open space built the Ringstrasse\u2014a meticu</span><span>lously articulated addition to the old city. Architects </span><span>and urban planners solemnly outlined their ideas. There </span><span>were apartment blocks, and public squares and govern</span><span>ment buildings, and shopping arcades, each executed in </span><span>what w\u2014</span><span>a grand mall</span><span>\u2014</span><span>was built around the city, </span><span>with wide sidewalks and expansive urban views, where </span><span>Viennese of all backgrounds could mingle freely on </span><span>their Sunday afternoon stroll. To the Viennese reform</span><span>ers of the time, the quality of civic life was a function </span><span>of the quality of the built environment, and Gruen thought that principle applied just as clearly to the American suburbs.</span></p><p><span>To Gruen, American suburbia was chaos, and the </span><span>only solution to chaos was planning. When Gruen first </span><span>drew up the plans for Southdale, he placed the shopping </span><span>center at the heart of a tidy four-hundred-and-sixty-</span><span>three-acre development, complete with apartment </span><span>buildings, houses, schools, a medical center, a park, and </span><span>a lake.</span></p><p><span>Victor Gruen's grand plan for Southdale was never </span><span>realized. There were no parks or schools or apartment </span><span>buildings\u2014just that big box in a sea of parking. Nor, </span><span>with a few exceptions, did anyone else plan the shop</span><span>ping mall as the centerpiece of a tidy; dense, multi-use </span><span>development. Gruen was right about the transformative </span><span>effect of the mall on retailing. But in thinking that he </span><span>could re\u00ebnact the lesson of the Ringstrasse in American </span><span>suburbia he was wrong.</span></p><p><span>When, late in life, Gruen came to realize this, it </span><span>was a powerfully disillusioning experience. He revis</span><span>ited one of his old shopping centers, and saw all the </span><span>sprawling development around it, and pronounced him</span><span>self in \"severe emotional shock.\" Malls, he said, had </span><span>been disfigured by \u201cthe ugliness and discomfort of the </span><span>land-wasting seas of parking\" around them. Developers </span><span>were interested only in profit. He turned away from his </span><span>adopted country. He had fixed up a country house out</span><span>side of Vienna, and soon he moved back home for </span><span>good. But what did he find when he got there? Just </span><span>south of old Vienna, a mall had been built\u2014in his </span><span>anguished words, a \"gigantic shopping machine.\" It </span><span>was putting the beloved independent shopkeepers of </span><span>Vienna out of business. It was crushing the life of his </span><span>city. He was devastated.Victor Gruen invented the </span><span>shopping mall in order to make America more like </span><span>Vienna.

The Espaillats have always been poets, one </span><span>uncle (on the Espaillat side) noted. Another uncle </span><span>believed that I probably got the writing genes from my </span><span>father's side of the family.</span></p><p><span>I can't help thinking that maybe my writing genes, </span><span>in fact, </span><span>come directly from my father. When we emi</span><span>grated to this country and my father had to start over as </span><span>a doctor, he gave up his other life's ambition of writing </span><span>books. Instead, he wrote weekly letters to my sisters </span><span>and me in boarding school in which he detailed the </span><span>adventures of a young boy, Babinchi, an autobiographi</span><span>cal version of himself. At the end of each letter was the </span><span>little moral we should learn from this recent scrape </span><span>Babinchi had gotten himself into.</span></p><p><span>My sisters and I would roll our eyes, but in fact, </span><span>we cared very much for those letters, \"the favorite\" </span><span>bragging that she had gotten the original as opposed to </span><span>one of three carbon copies. (Papi finally figured out </span><span>how to sidestep our jealousy by regularly rotating the </span><span>carbons. ) Obviously, I have gotten a touch of the poet </span><span>from him.</span></p><p><span>It's nice to have the family finally arguing over</span><span> who can lay claim to me. In fact, it's the fulfillment of </span><span>the childhood desire in the playground to be picked for </span><span>one of the teams instead of left over to be taken on as a </span><span>handicap: \"Okay, we'll take Alvarez, but we get to have </span><span>four outs instead of three.\"</span></p><p>For so many years, I was an embarrassment that <span>my parents had to explain to the rest of the Dominican </span><span>family. The thing that had gone wrong with my sisters </span><span>and myself, according to the extended family back </span><span>home, was that we had settled in the United States of </span><span>America where people got lost because they didn't have </span><span>their family around to tell them who they were. Instead, </span><span>they spent their lives, wandering around, doing crazy </span><span>things trying \"to find themselves.\"</span></p><p><span>The family was partly right, of course. My sisters </span><span>and I entered this country and our teens at the height of </span><span>the sixties, in the company of friends who were, many </span><span>of them, dropping out of their families, joining com</span><span>munes, demonstrating against the war, and spending the </span><span>night in jail. Meanwhile, back home, our female </span><span>cousins were having their quincea\u00f1era (fifteenth birth</span><span>day) parties in which they waltzed with their papis in </span><span>sight of all their relatives. By twenty-five, many were </span><span>leading settled lives with children and households. </span><span>They knew who they were, Alvarez or Tavares, </span><span>Berm\u00fadez or Espaillat. But in America, you didn't go by what your family had been in the past, you created yourself anew. This was part of the excitement as well as the confusing challenge of America.</span></p><p><span>Well, at long last, after almost thirty years of self-</span><span>creation, I began publishing novels, which were well </span><span>received. Now my family saw those endless years of </span><span>struggle in a whole new light. I had shown this poetic </span><span>talent from the beginning, and they had always known </span><span>it. I had never let mishaps or misfortunes and unem</span><span>ployment get in my way.</span></p><p><span>The change in their attitude proves, if nothing else, </span><span>how even our memories favor the classic Aristotelian </span><span>structure of narrative\u2014with a beginning, middle, and </span><span>end. If the ending is \"happy,\" then the events that pre</span><span>cede it suddenly light up with meaningful significance.</span></p><p><span>But where <i>did</i> it come from, this writing talent? It </span><span>is a family habit, after all, to trace the features of its </span><span>present members back to the faces of the ancestors. </span><span>Every time a new grandchild or grand niece arrives, the </span><span>old t\u00edas (aunts) stand around the crib, trying to decide </span><span>whose nose little Gaby is wearing. Those hands are </span><span>pure Rochet. The ears are Gonz\u00e1lez. As for the dark </span><span>skin, that comes from the G\u00f3mez side.</span></p><p><span>It gratifies me that whatever talent I do have might </span><span>have come from somewhere else. For one thing, it </span><span>clears me of blame for upsetting those same members </span><span>of my family when they actually sit down and read </span><span>what I've written. But also it reminds me that I am just </span><span>one more embodiment of that force for expression and </span><span>clarity and comprehension which has nothing specifi</span><span>cally to do with me, or just with me. As Jean Rhys, </span><span>another writer with a strong connection to the </span><span>Caribbean, once said to a young writer wanting some </span><span>advice, \"Feed the sea, feed the sea. The little rivers dry </span><span>up, but the sea continues. \"All that we write and </span><span>achieve as individuals means finally very little com</span><span>pared to the great body of work\u2014books, music, dance, </span><span>art, inventions, ideas\u2014that forms the culture and con</span><span>text of our human family.</span></p>", "question": "21.

But a study suggests that the widespread image is misleading\u2014that among male lions, a baldish head with sideburns may have been as prevalent in Africa as heavy manes, at least until recent years. The size of a lion's mane, the researchers concluded, appears to be a function of elevation and climate.</p><p>In 2001, Thomas Gnoske,a zoologist at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, spent his summer in the mountains along the equator in Tsavo, Kenya. Accompanied by Harald Schuetz, a photographer, Gnoske had set out to document the physical characteristics of lions living at different altitudes.<br/></p><p>Gnoske and Julian C. Kerbis Peterhans, a professor of natural sciences at Roosevelt University in Chicago, had previously studied museum specimens, 19th-century accounts from hunters, historical photographs and scientific descriptions of lions. All of these things led them to suspect that manelessness was typical in some parts of Kenya and might have been widespread in Africa many decades ago. Gnoske and Dr. Kerbis Peterhans had learned of many accounts of elevation and latitude influencing mane development, so they set out to record the locations of more than 60 maneless lions.<br/></p><p>In hot equatorial climates that are within 1,000 feet of sea level, they found, the lions often had hardly any mane at all. By contrast, lions at higher elevations and in colder climates had full, thick manes. At middle elevations, mane size tended to be intermediate, resembling a wreath extending from cheeks to shoulders. \"Recently, lions that don't have manes have been described as freaks and isolated anomalies or were dismissed as young, juvenile lions,\" Dr. Kerbis Peterhans said. \"But Tom was the first recent investigator to recognize that there is a complete range of variability in mane development and that a huge factor is climate.\"</p><p>Gnoske and Dr. Kerbis Peterhans believe that maneless lions have been depicted as anomalies because much of the earlier research was limited to a few habitats. Heavily maned lions usually live in well-protected tourist arcas or parks, while the habitats of maneless lions are generally unprotected.
