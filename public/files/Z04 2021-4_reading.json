The grandson of West Indian immigrants, </span><span>Holmes was raised in Gordon Heights, on Long </span><span>Island, in what he calls \"a small black community </span><span>founded by like-minded thinkers,\" families of immigrants </span><span>and Southern blacks who, as Holmes says, </span><span>\"didn\u2019t come here to fool around\" and who handed </span><span>down to their children their own keen sense of </span><span>ambition.</span></p><p><span>\"We grew up in that kind of atmosphere,\" he says, </span><span>\"of positive thinking, of getting educated, whether or </span><span>not you had a degree.\"</span></p><p><span>Like any American boy in the 1950s and \u201960s, he </span><span>was fascinated with popular music: He listened to the </span><span>area\u2019s one radio station, which \"mostly played Sinatra\"; </span><span>sometimes in the evenings, with a coat hanger stuck </span><span>into the top of his portable radio, he could pick up a </span><span>faint signal from WWRL, a rhythm and blues station in </span><span>New York City. When he was a teenager, his brother </span><span>brought home a guitar. \"I was 16, it was a Sunday </span><span>night,\" he says. \"I sat down and played 'I Can't Get No </span><span>Satisfaction.' I was addicted.\"</span></p>\n<p>While he was not a virtuoso, he was, he discovered, <span>good at making money at it. He learned three </span><span>songs\u2014\"Satisfaction\" by the Rolling Stones, \"And I </span><span>Love Her\" by the Beatles, and \"Shotgun\" by Junior </span><span>Walker and the All Stars\u2014and formed a band. \"We </span><span>went out and sold it,\" he says. \"We could play those </span><span>three songs all night. We got pretty popular out on the </span><span>island, playing battle of the bands, fire halls, high </span><span>school proms, for $10 a night.\"</span></p><p><span>Still, a career as a musician was not what he, or his </span><span>family, had had in mind. Over the next few years, he </span><span>says: \"I did everything I could not to be a guitar player. </span><span>I went to college not to be a guitar player.\" Thinking he </span><span>would be a psychiatrist, he took pre-med classes but </span><span>didn\u2019t complete a degree. Along the way, he continued </span><span>playing nightclubs and parties.</span></p><p>In his mid-20s, he visited his brother in Washington. <span>Washington looked, to Holmes, like a good place to </span><span>be an ambitious, career-minded black man, but it also </span><span>had a thriving music scene in nightclubs and hotel </span><span>lounges, and the next 15 years played out as a sort of </span><span>tussle between his creative pursuits and his more business-</span><span>driven impulses. Trying to work his way up in the </span><span>music scene, he played five and six nights a week in </span><span>nightclubs and wrote his own music.

And \"it changed </span><span>the culture of what I was doing.\"</span></p><p>Holmes was well-suited for the role of event bandleader. <span>His production skills helped him control his </span><span>band\u2019s sound, and his familiarity with country, big-band </span><span>and classical music made him popular with audiences </span><span>who wanted, as he says, \"a tango or a Viennese waltz,\" </span><span>as well as Wilson Pickett.</span></p><p><span>Because business ebbs and flows with the seasons </span><span>and the economy, Holmes has always kept a variety of </span><span>sidelines, including a job driving a limousine for nine </span><span>years to put his oldest daughter through a private high </span><span>school and college. These days, at gigs, he hands out a </span><span>stack of million-dollar \u201cbills\u201d printed with his image </span><span>and his current enterprises: bandleader, commercial </span><span>mortgage broker, hard money lender.</span></p><p>Holmes uses as many as eight musicians and two <span>singers for weddings. He accepts turnover as a fact of </span><span>running a band, but his current core lineup has, in the </span><span>mercurial world of part-time performers, been fairly </span><span>steady. Sam Brawner, the drummer, and Atiba Taylor, </span><span>the sax player, have played with him for three and four </span><span>years, respectively, and Bruce Robinson, the keyboardist, </span><span>has played with him for 15.</span></p><p>This is perhaps partly because Holmes insists on <span>making music. During performances, he lets his musicians </span><span>take the lead and uses specialized, stripped-down </span><span>tracks, called digital sequences, to set the tempo and fill </span><span>in musical parts when necessary, ultimately preferring </span><span>the messy alchemy of live music to <b class=\"now\">something more </b></span><span><b class=\"now\">canned</b>. The musicians say that this is in contrast to </span><span>other bandleaders they\u2019ve worked for, who often rely </span><span>heavily on recordings and use musicians more as visual </span><span>props. Holmes\u2019s respect for the music endears him to </span><span>his musicians. \"These guys play from the heart,\" says </span><span>Robinson. \"They\u2019re not just trying to get through the </span><span>gig.\"</span></p>", "question": "20.

Photographers also accompanied <span>government </span><span>expeditions to the West where they documented traditional </span><span>cultures, leading the way for tourists and commercial </span><span>photographers who followed, carrying their </span><span>cameras and preconceptions into Native American communities. </span><span>These efforts generated a legacy of photographic </span><span>images of American Indian people that can </span><span>serve today as rich educational resources. But if used </span><span>carelessly, they can also fu</span>el romanticized an<span>d stereotypical perceptions of American Indians.</span></p><p><span>Consider some of the many photographs of </span><span>Goyathlay, the Apache man who Mexicans named </span><span>\"Geronimo.\" He and other Chiricahua Apaches fought a </span><span>protracted war from 1863 to 1886 against the United </span><span>States for the right to live in thei</span>r traditional ho<span>melands rather than on reservations.</span></p><p><span>The Chiricahua Apaches' fight for freedom captured </span><span>the American imagination in the late nineteenth </span><span>century. \"Geronimo,\" especially, became a legendary </span><span>figure and a media phenomenon whose legacy has </span><span>lasted into the twenty-first century. He became synonymous </span><span>with courage, daring, and savage ruthlessness. </span><span>World War II paratroopers shouted his name as they </span><span>jumped from airplanes into combat. Movies, television </span><span>shows, comic books, popular songs, posters, T-shirts, </span><span>and American cities have borne his image and name. </span><span>One photo that shows Goyathlay and three other Chiricahuas </span><span>in their camp just prior to surrendering to U.S. </span><span>forces in 1886 documents a critical and difficult day for </span><span>the people who had fought so diligently for their </span><span>freedom.</span></p><p><span>In another well-known studio portrait, circa 1890, </span><span>Goyathlay poses with a rifle.

They are annuals that spring </span><span>up from dry, dormant, heat-resistant seeds. Some of </span><span>these seeds may wait up to half a century before they </span><span>are activate</span>d. The plants' challenge is to be quick enough to respond to rain so that they can produce their seeds before the earth dries up again, while not jumping the gun to start growth until there is sufficient water for them to grow to maturity for seed production. Som<span>e </span><span>achieve this balance on a tightrope</span> by \"measuring\" rainfall. They have chemicals in their seeds that inhibit germination, and a minimum amount <span>of rain is required </span><span>before these are leached out. Others have seed coats </span><span>that must be mechanically scarred to permit sufficient </span><span>wetting for germination, and the scarring happens only </span><span>when they are subjected to flash floods in the riverbeds </span><span>where they grow. A plant in the Negev Desert releases </span><span>its seed from a tough capsule only under the influence </span><span>of water through a mechanism that resembles a Roman </span><span>ballistic machine. Its two outer sepals generate sideways </span><span>tension that can fling two seeds out of the fruit, </span><span>but the two seeds are held inside by a lock mechanism </span><span>at the top. However, when the sepals are sufficiently </span><span>wetted, then the tension increases to such a</span>n extent tha<span>t the lock mechanism snaps, and the capsule \"explodes\" </span><span>and releases the seeds.</span></p><p><span>In moist regions where it rains predictably (though </span><span>not necessarily in abundance), we help agricultural </span><span>plants to capture the precipitation by scarring the soil to </span><span>facilitate the infiltration of the water into it, and hence </span><span>into the roots. Least runoff and maximum water absorption </span><span>are achieved by plowing the soil. However, such a </span><span>strategy would not work in a true desert such as the </span><span>Negev. A different program is required there because </span><span>rain is infrequent and plowing would facilitate only the </span><span>evaporation of scarce water from the soil. The solution </span><span>applied by the peoples who inhabited the Negev in past </span><span>centuries was a practice they called \"runoff farming.\" </span><span>Farmers had mastered harnessing the flash floods that </span><span>rush down into the gullies by catching the runoffs\u2014not </span><span>only by making terraces but also by building large cisterns </span><span>into which the water was directed to be held for </span><span>later use. Remnants of these constructions still exist.</span></p><p><span>Water-storage mechanisms have been invented by </span><span>other organisms living in deserts, but mainly through </span><span>modifications of body plan. Many plants, especially </span><span>cacti and euphorbia, have the ability to swell their roots </span><span>or stems with water stores. Possibly the most familiar is </span><span>the saguaro cactus, <i>Carnegiea gigantea</i>, of the Sonoran </span><span>desert in the American southwest. It has a shallow root </span><span>system that extends in all directions to distances of </span><span>about its height, fifty feet. In one rainstorm the root </span><span>system can soak up 200 gallons of water, which are</span><span> transferred into its tall trunk. This trunk is pleated like </span><span>an accordion and can swell to store tons of water that </span><span>can last the plant for a year. The cactus has no leaves, </span><span>but the stem is green and can photosynthesize and produce </span><span>nutrients as well as store water. The saguaro's survival </span><span>strategy requires it to grow extremely slowly. But </span><span>it lives a century or more.</span></p><p>Some desert animals similarly store water. The frog Cyclorana platycephala, from the northern Australian desert, fills up and greatly expands its urinary bladder to use as a water bag before burying itself in the soil, where it spends most of the year waiting for the next rain. While in the ground it sloughs off skin and forms around itself a nearly waterproof cocoon that resembles a plastic bag and reduces evaporative water loss.</p><p><span>Desert ants of a variety of species (of at least </span><span>seven different genera) in American as well as Australian </span><span>deserts collectively called \"honeypot ants\" have </span><span>evolved a solution that combines water storage with </span><span>energy storage. Ants typically feed each other; and </span><span>some of the larger worker ants may take up more liquid </span><span>than the others, and others may bring more. Those that </span><span>take the fluid may gorge themselves until they distend </span><span>their abdomens up to the size of a grape, by which time </span><span>they are unable to move from the spot. They then hang </span><span>in groups of dozens to hundreds from the ceiling of a </span><span>chamber in the ant nest, where they are then the specialized </span><span>so-called repletes that later regurgitate fluid </span><span>when the colony members are no longer bringing the </span><span>fluid in but rather needing it.</span></p>", "question": "40.
