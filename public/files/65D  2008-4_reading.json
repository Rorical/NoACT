Martha is Ola\u2019s friend and neighbor.</span></h5><p>I think about how everybody Ola knows her has a story. Daddy says that everybody has one and their stories are all a part of us. If Ola loves these people, then they must be a part of me too.It must be true about all of us being a part of one another like Daddy says.</p><p>Ola hums on the porch while Mama eats an apple and labels boxes. I go over to the phone by the refrigerator and call Martha. When she picks up, her voice rings out and is so familiar. I tell her Ola\u2019s idea about making a movie.</p><p>Martha Jackson\u2019s hair is the color of coal and she must be about my grandmama\u2019s age. She cuts her hair short, and sometimes it sticks straight up, but she doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>She\u2019s probably one of the tallest people I know, and walks like she\u2019s swimming. Martha looks at you for a long time before she decides to speak.</p><p>She\u2019s learning on a Joshua tree in Ola\u2019s front yard, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like poetry and eating to me now. You let the camera become part of you. Like your head and your eyes. If the camera were to fall out of your hands, it should be like your head falling off in the middle of a conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if the camera can ever be that special to me, Martha,\u201d I say. \u201cI just got used to the camera my dad gave me four years ago. I can\u2019t remember to take off the lens cap sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Martha smiles, \u201cThis is a thing to get used to\u2014that\u2019s all. No magic, no special real training. Turn the camera on and shoot.\u201d</p><p>I take the camera and start taping a crow that\u2019s landed on the back porch. I figured it\u2019s a start. The crow gets real interested in me filming him and stops pecking at the old people core he\u2019s found near the garbage cans. He hops off the porch and checks me and the camera out till he sees something else off over by some brush.</p><p>Martha\u2019s watching me with a smirk when I turn back to her with the camera. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll do okay by yourself now.\u201d She looks at me for a long time, then says, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Ola.\u201d</p><p>I start shooting and say to myself, \u201cA part of me,\u201d and hope that the thing is going and the lens cap hasn\u2019t been on the whole time I\u2019ve been taping the crow. I zoom in on Martha learning against the Joshua tree. She stares into the camera.</p><p>\u201cI met Ola in the late summer of 1964 \u2019cause there was no other way around it.\u201d</p><p>A pot falls in the kitchen, and we can hear Ola laughing\u2014then she stops. I keep the camera running.</p><p>\u201cLike I was saying,\u201d Martha starts to whisper, but changes her mind and speaks even louder. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but meet her. There\u2019s about five hundred people that live out here, and she happens to be my closest neighbor. She was playing her music loud one night, and I was sitting out in my yard.\u201d</p><p>Ola comes out the screen door and sits down by Martha Jackson. Two people couldn\u2019t be more different in looks. I have them both in the frame.</p><p>Ola\u2019s short and delicate\u2014like she\u2019d break if you held her arm too tight. <b class=\"now\">She wouldn\u2019t break, though.</b> She hands Martha a glass of iced tea and sits cross-legged on the ground.</p><p>I press the pause button, then change my mind.

Even though the two snacks have the same calorie count, she finds that people who eat the high-volume snack feel more satisfied. Eating AU Lean, in short, isn\u2019t going to leave you with a craving for more calories; you\u2019ll feel just as full.</span></p><p><span>For anyone looking to improve the quality of fast food, all this is heartening news. It means that you should be able to put low-fat cheese and low-fat mayonnaise in a</span><span> </span><span>fast-food hamburger without anyone\u2019s complaining. It also means that there\u2019s no particular reason to use twenty-per-cent-fat ground beef in a fast-food burger. In 1990, using just this argument, the Auburn team suggested to McDonald\u2019s that it make a hamburger</span><span> </span><span>AU Lean. Shortly thereafter, McDonald\u2019s came out with the McLean Deluxe. Other fast-food houses scrambled to follow suit. Nutritionists were delighted. And fast food appeared on the verge of a revolution.</span></p><p><span>Only, it wasn\u2019t. The McLean was a flop, and four years later it was off the market. What happened? Part of the problem appears to have been that McDonald\u2019s rushed the burger to market before many of the production kinks had been worked out. More important, though, was the psychological handicap the burger faced. People liked AU Lean in blind taste tests because they didn\u2019t know it was AU Lean; they were fooled into thinking it was regular ground beef. But nobody was fooled when it came to the McLean Deluxe. It was sold as the healthy choice\u2013and who goes to McDonald\u2019s for health food?</span></p><p><span>That is sobering news for those interested in improving the American diet. For years, the nutrition movement in this country has made transparency one of its principal goals: it has assumed that the best way to help people improve their diets is to tell them precisely what\u2019s in their food, to label certain foods good and certain foods bad. But transparency can backfire, because sometimes nothing is more deadly for our taste buds than the knowledge that what we are eating is good for us.</span><span> </span></p>", "question": "20.

Johann Sebastian Bach was impressed by the first piano he tried, but he pointed out limitations that still needed to be worked on: a heavy action and a treble that was not loud enough.</span><span> </span><span>Two of his sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel and Johann Christian, championed the instrument in the next generation; by the time Johann Christian Bach gave England\u2019s first solo piano performance in 1768, the</span><span> </span><span>triumph of this new instrument over the harpsichord was assured.</span></p><p><span>The role of the keyboard as a solo instrument came to the fore musically.</span><span> </span><span>It was no longer just another part of the ensemble, and its unique volume freed it from the confines of the drawing room to which the harpsichord had almost always been consigned.</span><span> </span><span>Haydn and Mozart both wrote masterful sonatas for the new instrument, its keyboard was greatly expanded, and its dynamic range\u2014the single feature that most</span><span> </span><span>distinguished it from the harpsichord\u2014was exploited fully.</span><span> </span><span>A whole new technique stressing fluidity was developed for the piano, and Mozart wrote: \u201cIt should flow like oil.\u201d Solo concerts became the norm rather than the exception, and a class of instrumentalists with technique and power arrived on the scene.</span></p><p><span>What had been a tinkerer\u2019s offshoot among harpsichord makers became an industry in its own right. London and Vienna were its focal points.</span><span> </span><span>The two capitals gave rise to distinct schools of piano building, the</span><span> </span><span>principal difference having to do with how the action\u2014the intricate mechanism that activates the hammers to strike the strings\u2014was conceived and assembled.</span><span> </span><span>Viennese pianos were generally softer, with a refined singing tone that allowed the melody to come to the fore; the pianos themselves had delicate cabinetry.</span><span> </span><span>English pianos, on the other hand, had a more robust tone, with a stronger action and greater tension in the strings; they had solid cases and sturdy frames.</span><span> </span><span>The great Viennese composers of the classical era\u2014Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven\u2014played Viennese pianos, but the transition to the stronger instruments of the English school can be seen in Beethoven\u2019s last piano sonatas.</span></p><p><span>Beethoven was known for the increasing dynamic contrasts in his works for piano, from whisper to thunder, and he sometimes destroyed the fragile Viennese pianos when playing his music.</span><span> </span><span>He had a strong influence on the direction of piano manufacture, and as early as 1796 he expressed his frustration with the overly delicate styles of playing that were a holdover from harpsichords.</span></p><p><span>In 1818, Broadwood, the pre-eminent English manufacturer of the day , offered him a grand</span><span> </span><span>piano that incorporated all of the latest features: stronger case and frame, trichord stringing, more responsive action.</span><span> </span><span>This</span><span> </span><span>piano, too, Beethoven damaged with the fervor of his playing (a contemporary reported that</span><span> </span><span>\u201cthe broken strings were jumbled up like a thorn bush in a storm\u201d), but he remained attached to it until his death in 1827.</span><span> </span><span>He imagined music unlike anything his contemporaries were writing; the</span><span> </span><i>Hammerklavier</i><span> sonata from this period still strikes many as a revelation of the piano\u2019s extreme limits of power and expressiveness.</span></p><p></p>", "question": "30.
