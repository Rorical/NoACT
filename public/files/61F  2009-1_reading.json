I call her that because it's what my mother called her the first time I came here with my uncles. Ama's about the same age as my mother, and they are cousins in a roundabout way, but Mama calls her that out of respect for what she knows and who she is. Mama respects her and is jealous. Mama's made her choices and they are different. She'd like to learn from the old people, live the way we used to, but she wants it modern, too. Ama says it's not about choices but about heart and heart is what Mama's low on. Because of how Ama lives, she's a woman both admired and ridiculed, sometimes by the same people and in the same moment of time. What she's got is herself, and that's all she has. She has no lights or television or washing machine, but sometimes, even so, I think she's got more than the rest of us because she believes in herself, in what she does. It's the way she lives in this place.</p><p><span>Since the first time I was here, I've kept coming back, but I come alone now. The first time I came was when my uncles sent me to ask her if they could cut some trees nearby. I stood in front of her, a small girl, but not as afraid of her as my uncles were. Her eyes were the color of river mud after the wash of a storm, her neck too bony, her collarbone protruding. I stood here with something like courage, on this very porch, and asked her about the trees.</span></p><p><span>She looked me over like she was thinking all the same things about me, then asked, \"Which trees?\"</span></p><p><span>I could smell fish frying behind her, in her house.</span></p><p><span>I pointed. \"Those ones that are dying out there. We'll bring you back some of </span>the<span> wood,\" I said. \"Uncle Sonny says you could use some.\"</span></p><p><span>\"All right. Go ahead.\" And that was all we said. She turned and went back to the fish dinner cooking on the stove. She had a screen door then. I had seen her through the screen. And I saw her older than she is. But when I went back to </span>help<span> take the wood to her, she invited me in and gave me a glass of sweet tea to drink. </span><span>I sat down with her at the table and we talked, and she looked nice then, her hair shiny and clean around her shoulders, her eyes soft.</span></p><p><span>\"You know my mother,\" I said, taking in her hair, her hands that looked small and old from hard work. \"She's your cousin.\" And she said, \"Yes, I do, and you're nothing like her at all.\" That was what won me over to Ama.</span></p><p><span>After that, they told me not to be going </span>out<span> to her place. But I come here anyway and I help her out and no one says much to me about it. I bring her ice sometimes, or sugar for </span>her<span> tea, or other small things I pilfer from my mother's </span>place<span>, a can opener or strainer, perhaps. My mama knows I come and help her out even though she pretends she doesn't.</span></p><p>Ama likes having me here. It's better than being at home. It's like being part of the world. Some days we go out and fish. Fishing has its lessons. It teaches me to be still. And holding still is not something that comes easy to me. I'm learning from Ama how to survive and be friends with this land, and this is a place where a girl can get lost and the swamps and trees would eat her alive. It's a dangerous place with dark corners. On the days when Ama is silent, I learn from her stillness. It's not that she's moody. It's not an empty quiet, either, the way it would be with some people. It's a full silence and I like sitting with it and it's a relief from the chattiness of my sister and mom. I can't say what I learn from it; there's no words for it. Words are such noisy things and silence is something you have to listen to and when you do, it takes you by the hand, it catches bold of you.

Still, I always want to stay with her. Maybe it's because I am afraid of everything and she's afraid of nothing and I want to Iearn this from her.

But the same companies expect their most ambitious and devoted workers to forgo such options or to take advantage of them only in order to spend more hours at the office. They adhere to a blueprint for success drafted 40 years ago when men went to work and women stayed home. In this conception, work is firmly in the center and \"personal life\" is squeezed into whatever space remains.</p><p>At a handful of companies, however, an experiment is underway that turns this formulation on its head. Rather than appending \"family friendly\" programs to a traditional conception of office life, these firms are redefining the nature of work itself, making balanced lives for employees a central tenet around which the rest of the company is designed.</p><p>Like most new philosophies, this one was born of necessity. Studies show workers want more balanced lives, and companies are wise to adapt if they want to stay competitive. Most corporations start out offering traditional job flexibility programs, but few employees take advantage of them. Child care would seem a good way to help workers handle family responsibilities, but in some cases it adds a new level of anxiety. With emergency child care available, for example, an employee can now come to work even when a child is too ill for day care, secure in the knowledge that a complete stranger is tending the toddler. \"We had to ask ourselves if this is really the message we wanted to be sending employees\u2014that work should come first no matter what,\" says Patricia Nazemetz, director of human resource policies and practices at a large technology company.</p><p>A more radical solution seems in order, and a few companies are finding it in a growing body of work by academics, psychologists, and management gurus. That work suggests that if businesses want to help people achieve balanced lives while helping firms profit, the answer is not to add more programs but to revamp fundamental notions about how people work.</p><p><b class=\"now\">Research supports the notion that the key to balancing work and family interests is a well-designed job, one where goals are clear and where workers have control over how, when, and where they get their work done. Underlying this is a recognition that employees have personal lives that sometimes get complicated. In a study conducted at a manufacturer of automotive products known for its family-friendly policies, researchers from the University of Chicago found that workers whose jobs allowed them autonomy and input in decisions benefited most from the company's work and family programs. These employees reported that the policies not only helped them balance work and family demands but made them more committed to their jobs: They submitted twice as many quality improvement suggestions as workers who did not use work-family benefits. If a job was designed poorly, however, offering little autonomy or control, the benefits were of little help.</b></p><p>Not all jobs, of course, seem to invite such reform. Factory shift workers have little choice but to report to work at specific hours. As a result, they are rarely able to take advantage of programs designed to give employees more flexibility in their lives. But if the work itself is designed in a less-structured way, with both personal and business goals in mind, even shift workers benefit.</p><p>At one car manufacturing company, for example, an unusual four-day, 10-hour-a-day workweek, with rotating day and night shifts, offers workers more options while allowing the company to keep the plant operating six days a week, 20 hours a day, with minimal overtime. Workers get five consecutive days off at the end of each three-week rotation. Because they don't need to use leave time for appointments, these employees have fewer personal obligations that cut into productivity. And because teams are responsible for deciding how management's goals will be met, employees who need a day off can simply switch with another team member when personal problems do arise.</p><p>Few companies, of course, have the luxury of creating a new work culture from scratch, as that company did. But even well-established companies can learn from the innovative auto manufacturer: When such changes start at the top and are driven by business need, they are likely to succeed.<br/></p>", "question": "20.
