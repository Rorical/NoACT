Question 75 asks about the preceding passage as a whole.Suppose the writers primary purpose had been to explain the way Boyd's photographs were used to make maps of the east coast of Greenland. Would this essay accomplish that purpose?", "choices": {"A": "Yes, because the writer hints that because Boyd had studied photogrammetry, she deliberately created photographs that could be used to make maps.", "B": "Yes, because the writer makes clear that Boyd had photographed a region that, before her expeditions, had not been thoroughly documented.", "C": "No, because although the writer mentions that Boyd's photographs were used to make maps, the writer does not elaborate on how this was done.", "D": "No, because the writer instead focuses on describing how Boyd positioned her camera to create high-resolution images of glaciers."}, "correct": "C"}]}
