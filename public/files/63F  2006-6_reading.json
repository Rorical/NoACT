Come on, let's go,\" we swarmed out behind him, anxious about missing something special.</span></p><p><span>The block party was up on East Fordham Road, around Roosevelt High School. We arrived while the band was performing one of Tito's classics, \"El Cayuco\u201d or \u201cOye C\u00f3mo Va\" or \u201dRan Kan Kan.\" A crowd filled the street\u2014vendors were selling hot dogs, <i>pasteles</i>, chorizo sandwiches, sodas; women danced; most of the men too, in T-shirts OI guayaberas, weary from their week of work but happy to be there. It was a hot day, and we worked our way through all the people toward the stage. There, on the plumber's-pipe platform, were a trombonist, a saxophone player, a few trumpeters, a pianist, a fellow banging the congas and bongos, then a bassist, a man playing a standard drum kit and Tito Puente himself, drumsticks in hand, poised before the thin kettledrums that were his timbales, beside the vibraphone on which he would also perform the sublime \u201cHong Kong Mambo.\"</span></p><p><span>When you're a young musician\u2014or think you are\u2014you watch everything a real musician does.So I observed Tito Puente carefully. There he was, performing regally, as if his working-class audience were and: queens, as if that street were the greatest venue in all of New York. He was already a legend, so much a part of the history of New York and of Latin music (for he had been a hallmark performer in the glory days of the Palladium ballroom in the 1950's) that it would have been easy for him to slough the music off. But he played his heart out. He froze time, dissipated heat and cheered hearts.</span></p><p>He went into jams\u2014long, sustained mambo sections, during which his instrumentalists improvised\u4e00and played his drums as if there were no tomorrow. He sweated, dabbing his brow with a kerchief, and off-handedly introduced his own formidable compositions if they were simply little tunes. That music flew as toward us like elongating barrels of mischief, like singing angels, like mysterious sonic hieroglyphics, all transmitted: from some sacred musical place for our amusement. From the time we arrived, he and his band played for another hour, and not once did he give the impression that he wanted the beautifully, when the band had finished its last encore, when everybody, party to be over. Most even the kids hanging off the rooftops, were chanting \u201cTito!\" he bowed to the audience, sent kisses flying and then began to walk off stage. That's when our lead singer, Santiago, who had <b class=\"now\">passed</b> the concert jumping up and down in place, scrambled toward him. He caught Tito's ear with the phrase \"<i>Soy borinque\u00f1o!</i>\"\u2014 \u201dI'm Puerto Rican\" \u2014 and Tito, nodding, called him aside and listened to Santiago's story\u201419 years:old and I want to be a great musician like you and what I, eavesdropping, heard from Tito were the words, \"I'll look out for you, kid. <i>Y exitos</i>\u201c\u2014much success.</p>", "question": "30.
