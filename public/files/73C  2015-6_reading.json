He had raced down the stairs seconds after my birth, as soon as the doctor had assured him that I was all right. While filling out my certificate, Baba realized that he didn\u2019t know my sex for sure but that didn\u2019t matter; he\u2019d always known I was a boy, had spoken to me as a boy while I was in Mama, and as he approached the box that contained the question, NAME OF CHILD, he wrote with a quivering hand and in his best English cursive, Nidal (strife; struggle). It was not my grandfather\u2019s name, and Baba, whose name is Waheed and who was known during his childhood as Said, was the only son of the family, so the onus of renaming a son after my grandfather fell squarely upon his shoulders. It was an onus he brushed off his then-solid shoulders unceremoniously, like a piece of lint or a flake of dandruff; these are analogies my grandfather would the next day angrily pen in a letter sent from Jenin to Boston. </p><p>When he\u2019d filled out the entire form, Baba regally relayed it to the nurse, who he remembers was called Rhonda. Then Baba, in flip-flops, turned around and raced up the white-tiled hallway, bypassed the elevator, ran up the three floors to the maternity ward, and burst into the birthing room. </p><p>\u201cHow is my queen?\u201d said Baba, caressing my mother\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d Mama said, thinking he meant me, \u201cand eight whole pounds, the buffalo! No wonder my back was so ...\u201d Baba\u2019s brow furrowed, and Mama  couldn't finish her complaint, because, eager to correct his mistake, Baba was already out the door and running down the white-tiled hallway, past new mothers and their red-faced babies, past hideous robes in uncalled-for patterns, bypassing the elevator, and sliding down  the banister of the staircase. He raced on, screaming for Rhonda, where is Rhonda, help me, Rhonda, an outcry that provided the staff with three weeks\u2019 worth of laughter. </p><p>Rhonda emerged with the birth certificate in hand, and Baba, who is not usually known for laziness, grabbed a pen and added at the end of my name a heavy, reflexive, feminizing, possessive, cursive \u201cI.\u201d </p><p>Moments later, Mama, who had just been informed of my <i>nom de guerre</i>, got out of bed and walked us to the elevator, the entire time ignoring my baba, who was screaming, \u201cNidali is a beautiful name, so unique, come on Ruz, don\u2019t be so rash, you mustn\u2019t be walking, you need to rest!\u201d </p><p>Mama must not have fought long, or who knows; maybe she went to the nurses\u2019 station and talked to Rhonda, and maybe Rhonda told her that the birth certificate was already sent out\u2014that Mama would have to go to the office of the City of Boston clerk and see the registrar of vital statistics, where they keep the birth <i>and</i> death certificates\u4e00and maybe Mama, who is the most superstitious of all humans (even more than Baba, and to that she\u2019ll attest) shuddered at the thought of taking me, a newborn, through the heat and the Boston traffic to a place where, she must\u2019ve imagined, people went to fill out death certificates, and she must\u2019ve further imagined that going on such a trip, to such a place, would surely bring about my death\u2014because I still have my name. </p><p>Whenever I imagined Baba running out just after my birth and sliding through the hallways like a movie star, I knew he must have embellished. Baba liked to do that: tell stories that were impossible but true all at once, especially if those stories made him look like a rock star. This is because he used to be a writer and was now an architect. Our little apartment was filled with blueprints and plastic models of houses instead of notebooks and poetry: a reality that filled him with great sadness. So Baba put that sadness into these stories. </p><p>Mama liked to expose him when he told such stories; she was his paparazzo, his story-cop.

Consumers were staying away from the \u201cdevilish contraptions\u201d in droves. In San Francisco in 1903, the horse and buggy was not going the way of the horse and buggy. </p><p>For good reason. The automobile, so sleekly efficient on paper, was in practice a civic menace, belching out exhaust, kicking up storms of dust, becoming hopelessly mired in the most innocuous-looking puddles, and tying up horse traffic. Incensed local lawmakers responded with monuments to legislative creativity. The laws of at least one town required automobile drivers to stop, get out, and fire off Roman candles every time horse-drawn vehicles came into view. Massachusetts tried and, fortunately, failed to mandate that cars be equipped with bells that would ring with each revolution of the wheels. In some towns police were authorized to disable passing cars with ropes, chains, and wires. San Francisco didn\u2019t escape the legislative wave. Bitter local officials pushed through an ordinance banning automobiles from all tourist areas, effectively exiling them from the city. </p><p>Nor were these the only obstacles. The asking price for the cheapest automobile amounted to twice the $500 annual salary of the average citizen\u4e00some cost three times that much\u2014and all that bought you was four wheels, , a body, and an engine. \u201cAccessories\u201d like bumpers, carburetors, and headlights had to be purchased separately. Navigation was a nightmare. The first of San Francisco\u2019s road signs were only just being erected, hammered up by an enterprising insurance underwriter who hoped to win clients by posting directions into the countryside, where drivers retreated for automobile \u201cpicnic parties\u201d held out of the view of angry townsfolk. </p><p>The first automobiles imported to San Francisco had so little power that they rarely made it up the hills. The grade of Nineteenth Avenue was so daunting for the engines of the day that watching automobiles straining for the top became a local pastime. </p><p>Passage B by Peter Carlson </p><p>In the mid-1950s, Ford Motor Company was building not one, not two, but 18 varieties of Edsel, including a convertible and a station wagon. The designers came up with some interesting ideas. They created a push-button transmission and put it in the middle of the steering wheel, where most cars have a horn. And they fiddled with the front end: Where other cars had horizontal chrome grilles, the Edsel would have a vertical chrome oval in its grille. It was new! It was different! </p><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work. It couldn\u2019t suck in enough air to cool the engine. \u201cThey had to keep opening up that oval to get more air in there.\u201d says Jim Arnold, who was a trainee in Edsel\u2019s design shop. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t look as good.\u201d </p><p>Edsel didn\u2019t have its own assembly lines, so the cars were produced in Ford and Mercury plants, which caused problems. Every once in a while, an Edsel would roll past workers who were used to Mercurys or other Fords. Confused, they sometimes failed to install all the parts before the Edsel moved on down the line. Cars without parts can be a problem, of course, but other aspects of the Edsel juggernaut worked  perfectly\u2014the hype, for instance. The Edsel PR team touted the glories of the cars, but wouldn\u2019t let anybody see them. When they finally released a photo, it turned out to be a picture of . . . the Edsel\u2019s hood ornament. And hundreds of publications actually printed it! </p><p>On September 4, 1957, proclaimed by Ford as E-Day, nearly 3 million Americans flocked to showrooms to see the Edsel. Unfortunately, very few of them bought the Edsel. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even get people to drive it,\u201d says C. Gayle Warnock, Edsel\u2019s public relations director. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t like the car. They just didn\u2019t like the front end.\u201d </p><p>But styling was hardly the worst problem. Oil pans fell off, trunks stuck, paint peeled, doors failed to close and the much-hyped \u201cTeletouch\u201d push-button transmission had a distressing tendency to freeze up. People joked that Edsel stood for \u201cEvery day something else leaks.\u201d </p><p>Another major problem was caused by bad luck: The Edsel was an upscale car launched a couple months after a stock market plunge caused a recession.

Through Homer\u2019s eyes, it is a world in which people live in close contact with nature and natural forces, a world where landscape and ocean are viewed not as a paradise but as powers and presences that can be enjoyed and whose threats can sometimes be overcome. And, particularly in his later paintings, it is a world imbued with a stark and melancholy atmosphere. </p><p>In 1867, two of Homer\u2019s canvases were chosen to hang at the Great Exposition in Paris. The artist spent 10 months in the city, which later proved to have a profound effect on his art.

The influence of Japanese art on Homer\u2019s painting was immediately apparent upon his return to the United States. The weakness of earlier compositions is replaced by a boldness and lucidity in which simple shapes are massed into powerful designs. </p><p>Although Homer\u2019s work of the 1870s gained strength, the artist continued to paint his genre subjects: tourist scenes, schoolchildren, and farm life. It wasn\u2019t until 1881, however, that he found the subject matter that would inspire him most. In that year, for reasons unknown, Homer went to England, where he elected to spend the summer at the town of Tynemouth on the coast of the North Sea. It is possible that he was searching for a town filled with the type of tourists and bathers that made his paintings of the Jersey shore successful back home. But Tynemouth was also a community of fishermen who wrested their livelihood from the dangerous and unpredictable waters of the North Sea. Moreover, the light and weather in that part of the world, so much farther north than Atlantic City, is much gloomier and more dramatic than that of the Jersey coast. It was there that Homer became enthralled by the dramas of the people who make their living from the ocean: the fishermen\u2019s wives staring out to sea as they wait for their men, the launch of the lifeboat to rescue sailors from a foundering ship, the agonizingly fragile fishing boats being tossed on angry waves. Here at last was a subject matter that matched the artist\u2019s deepest feelings. The dynamic and dangerous relationship between human activity and natural forces exposed in this setting would occupy Homer for many years to come. On his return to America he elected to leave New York and relocate to the rural town of Prouts Neck, Maine. </p><p>The legend of Winslow Homer is that he left New York civilization to become a recluse on the coast of Main for the last 25 years of his life. In reality, the property at Prouts Neck\u2014which included a large, rambling hotel building\u2014was purchased by his brother Charles for the whole extended Homer family. The artist also built a studio with an ocean view just yards away from the family house so throughout the summers he could enjoy the company of his father, his brothers and their wives, as well as the year-round guests of the many local people whose friendship he valued. Homer continued to travel frequently, spending parts of the winter in the Caribbean. But the artist always lived  alone, and when he was working, which was the large part of most of his days, he could be extremely short-tempered when interrupted. </p><p>The sea outside his window now inspired the artist to create what came to be known as his greatest paintings. The Maine coast is extremely rocky and prone to monstrous gales that\u2014at their most powerful\u2014can whip up the waves to 40 or 50 feet. Screaming winds can rip across the breakers, creating long horizontal trails of spray. Homer rendered this sea with all the  understanding of a painter who knows to simplify and synthesize. In paintings such as <i>Eastern Point</i> and <i>Cannon Rock</i> the construction of the water has been reorganized into clear graphic shapes and strong directional lines that echo the Japanese printmaking that had such a lasting effect on his work. The rocks in the paintings are massed into powerful, almost flat, designs and the brushing has become energetic, as though feeding from the physical strength of the ocean.

Parks (\u00a92006 by VNU Business Media).<br/></p><p>The images in the paintings of Winslow Homer epitomize a peculiarly American 19th-century world. Through Homer\u2019s eyes, it is a world in which people live in close contact with nature and natural forces, a world where landscape and ocean are viewed not as a paradise but as powers and presences that can be enjoyed and whose threats can sometimes be overcome. And, particularly in his later paintings, it is a world imbued with a stark and melancholy atmosphere. </p><p>In 1867, two of Homer\u2019s canvases were chosen to hang at the Great Exposition in Paris. The artist spent 10 months in the city, which later proved to have a profound effect on his art. A large display of Japanese prints was exhibited in the same building as his own paintings, and the process of simplification that it revealed and the wealth of pictorial invention it provided made a deep impression on the artist. The influence of Japanese art on Homer\u2019s painting was immediately apparent upon his return to the United States. The weakness of earlier compositions is replaced by a boldness and lucidity in which simple shapes are massed into powerful designs. </p><p>Although Homer\u2019s work of the 1870s gained strength, the artist continued to paint his genre subjects: tourist scenes, schoolchildren, and farm life. It wasn\u2019t until 1881, however, that he found the subject matter that would inspire him most. In that year, for reasons unknown, Homer went to England, where he elected to spend the summer at the town of Tynemouth on the coast of the North Sea. It is possible that he was searching for a town filled with the type of tourists and bathers that made his paintings of the Jersey shore successful back home. But Tynemouth was also a community of fishermen who wrested their livelihood from the dangerous and unpredictable waters of the North Sea. Moreover, the light and weather in that part of the world, so much farther north than Atlantic City, is much gloomier and more dramatic than that of the Jersey coast.
