In many lumber mills, bark has often been discarded as waste or burned in the open air. This poses a big problem in terms of groundwater contamination and air pollution. The exploitation of bark takes advantage of its three most important properties: its energy content, which is about the same as that of wood; its low density; and the diverse cellular contents. These physical properties and the high concentration of chemical cell contents explain the diverse potential uses for bark.</p><p>Cork oak (<i>Quercus suber</i>) is virtually without parallel among trees. It is the only one that is exploited industrially and exclusively for its bark: cork, a raw material whose properties are nearly impossible to duplicate artificially. This tree of the Mediterranean countries and of the adjacent Atlantic coasts is cultivated principally in Portugal, which with 330-440 million pounds per year provides 50% of world production. Portugal has more than 1.8 million acres of cork oaks under cultivation. Next come Spain, Algeria, Morocco, France, Italy, and Tunisia.</p><p>A standardized procedure is used for harvesting cork. When the cork oak reaches the age of 20-25 years and its trunk measures about 12 inches in diameter, it can be debarked (or stripped) for the first time. The virgin cork from this harvest is of low quality and is generally only used for granulated cork. After another 8-10 years, the cork will have regrown to a thickness of<img class=\"formula\" data-latex=\"1{^{1}{/}_{4}}-2\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"/><span> inches. The second harvest can then proceed, and thenceforth every 8-10 years to an age of 130-150 years if the tree holds up well and grows in favorable climatic conditions. Trees that are not subjected to this harvesting regime can live 300-400 years!</span></p><p><span>The uniqueness of the cork oak lies in the great ease with which the outer bark (cork and rhytidome) can be separated from the inner bark (bast), preserving the living part that produces the cork. The art of stripping, which is carried out from mid-June to mid-August (while the sap is rising), lies in making longitudinal and then horizontal cuts on the trunk in order to release strips or sheets without damaging the inner bark. Thus the growth of cork can resume without initiating faults in the new cork. The living bark, which is reddish yellow after debarking, gradually turns ochre thereafter, then brownish red over the course of weeks, and finally blackish gray after about a year.</span></p><p><span>Although cork is a dead bark, it should be considered a noble plant material since its intrinsic properties are numerous and irreplaceable by any single synthetic material of the same cost.

Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre, a Frenchman known for his elaborate and whimsical stage design in the Paris theater, began building on the work of Joseph Nicephore Niepce to try to produce a fixed image. Daguerre called the image he created in 1837 the \u201cdaguerreotype.\u201d He made extravagant claims for his device. It is \u201cnot merely an instrument which serves to draw nature,\u201d he wrote in 1838, it \u201cgives her the power to reproduce herself.\u201d</p><p>Despite its technological crudeness and often-spectral images, the daguerreotype was eerily effective at capturing glimmers of personality in its fixed portraits. The extant daguerreotypes of well-known Americans in the nineteenth century include: a young and serious Abraham Lincoln, sans beard; an affable Horace Greeley in stovepipe hat; and a dour picture of the suffragist Lucy Stone. A daguerreotype of Edgar Allan Poe, taken in 1848, depicts the writer with a baleful expression and crossed arms, and was taken not long before Poe was found delirious and near death on the streets of Baltimore.</p><p>But the daguerreotype did more than capture the posture of a poised citizenry. It also changed artists\u2019 perceptions of human nature. Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s 1851 Gothic romance, <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>, has an ancient moral (\u201cthe wrong-doing of one generation lives into the successive ones\u201d) but made use of a modern technology, daguerreotyping, to unspool its story about the unmasking of festering, latent evil. In the story, Holgrave, the strange lodger living in the gabled house, is a daguerreotypist (as well as a political radical) who says of his art: \u201cWhile we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface, it actually brings out the secret character with a truth no painter would ever venture upon, even could he detect it.\u201d It is Holgrave\u2019s silvery daguerreotypes that eventually reveal the nefarious motives of Judge Pyncheon\u2014and in so doing suggest that the camera could expose human character more acutely than the eye.</p><p>Author Oliver Wendell Holmes called the photo the \u201cmirror with a memory,\u201d and in 1859 predicted that the \u201cimage would become more important than the object itself and would in fact make the object disposable.\u201d But praise for the photograph was not universal.</p><p>In her elegant extended essay <i>On Photography</i>, the late Susan Sontag argues that images\u2014particularly photographs\u2014carry the risk of undermining true things and genuine experiences, as well as the danger of upending our understanding of art. \u201cKnowing a great deal about what is in the world (art, catastrophe, the beauties of nature) through photographic images,\u201d Sontag notes, \u201cpeople are frequently disappointed, surprised, unmoved when they see the real thing.\u201d This is not a new problem, of course; it plagued the art world when the printing process allowed the mass reproduction of great works of art, and its effects can still be seen whenever one overhears a museum-goer express disappointment that the Van Gogh he sees hanging on the wall is nowhere near as vibrant as the one on his coffee mug.</p><p>But Sontag\u2019s point is broader, and suggests that photography has forced us to consider that exposure to images does not necessarily create understanding of the things themselves. Images do not necessarily lead to meaning; the information they convey does not always lead to knowledge.

The journey would have been remarkable in any century, but was especially so in the late 1600s, when savants were still poking for answers to nature\u2019s riddles in the ruins of the classical world, quoting the authority of Pliny, the natural philosopher who had confidently proposed that butterflies were born from dew, and drawing their knowledge of animals from medieval bestiaries. Birds were categorized 20 according to notions of nobility, from most noble (eagles and hawks), to wise (owls), to big (ostriches), and on down the line. Caterpillars, if they were considered at all, were classified apart from winged insects and lumped together with worms and serpents.</p><p>From the Suriname capital, Paramaribo, Merian sailed up the Suriname River, stopping along its banks to collect caterpillars, then watching them closely for signs of metamorphosis and painting them at the pivotal moment. Two years later, sick of heat and fever, she returned home, loaded with specimens and hundreds of paintings of iguanas and geckos, fighting snakes and frog-eating scorpions, and dozens of moths and butterflies in various life stages on their native cassava, guava, batata, and pawpaw plants.</p><p>If we are to believe her journal. Merian knew the details of metamorphosis perhaps more intimately than the savants. Her paintings and journals address the step-by-step transfiguration not just of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) but also of amphibians. In 1686 she had precociously noted the developmental odyssey of frogs from black grains that \u201cfed on the white slime that surrounded them,\u201d to tiny creatures that grew little tails so that they could swim, then eyes, then, eight days later, two little feet \u201cfrom the skin at the back and after a further eight days two little feet at the front ...
