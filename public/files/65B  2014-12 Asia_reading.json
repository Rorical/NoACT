According to the passage, blushing apparently reaches its peak within:", "choices": {"A": " a half-second.", "B": " 5 seconds.", "C": " 10 to 12 seconds.", "D": " 15 to 20 seconds."}, "correct": "D"}, {"title": "Passage II", "name": "", "article": "<p><b>SOCIAL SCIENCE</b>: This passage is adapted from the article \"Crimson Tide\" by Atul Gawande (\u00a92001 by The Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications, Inc.).</p><p>In physiological terms, blushing is a mere redirection of blood flow. The face and neck have an unusual number of veins near the surface, and they can carry more blood than those of similar size elsewhere. Stimulated by certain neurological signals, they will dilate while other peripheral vessels contract: the hands will turn white and clammy even as the face flushes.</p><p>What is this peculiar phenomenon called blushing? A skin reaction? An emotion? A kind of vascular expression? Scientists have never been sure how to describe it. The blush is at once physiology and psychology. On the one hand, blushing is involuntary, uncontrollable, and external, like a rash. On the other hand, it requires thought and feeling at the highest order of cerebral function. \"Man is the only animal that blushes,\" author and humorist Mark Twain wrote. \"Or needs to.\"</p><p>Observers have often assumed that blushing is simply the outward manifestation of shame. But, as biologist Charles Darwin noted and puzzled over in an 1872 essay, it is not shame but the prospect of exposure, of humiliation, that makes us blush. \"A man may feel thoroughly ashamed of having told a small falsehood, without blushing, \" he wrote, \u201cbut if he even suspects that he is detected he will instantly blush, especially if detected by one whom he reveres.\"</p><p>But if it is humiliation that we are concerned about, why do we blush when we're praised? Or when people sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to us? Or when people just look at us? Michael Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, routinely demonstrates the effect in classes. He announces that he will randomly point at a student, that the pointing is meaningless and reflects no judgment whatever about the person. Then he closes his eyes and points. Everyone looks to see who it is. And, invariably, that person is embarrassed. In an odd experiment conducted a couple of years ago, two social psychologists, Janice Templeton and Mark Leary, wired subjects with facial-temperature sensors and put them on one side of a one-way mirror. The mirror was then removed to reveal an entire audience staring at them from the other side. Half the time the audience members were wearing dark glasses, and half the time they were not. Strangely, subjects blushed only when they could see the audience's eyes.</p><p>Blushing produces secondary effects of its own. It is itself embarrassing, and can cause self-consciousness, confusion, and loss of focus. (Darwin, struggling to explain why this might be, conjectured that the greater blood flow to the face drained blood from the brain.)</p><p>Why we have such a reflex is perplexing. One theory is that the blush exists to show embarrassment just as the smile exists to show happiness. This would explain why the reaction appears only in the visible regions of the body (the face, the neck, and the upper chest). But then why do dark-skinned people blush? Surveys find that nearly everyone blushes, regardless of skin color, despite the fact that in many people it is nearly invisible. And you don't need to turn red in order for people to recognize that you're embarrassed. Studies show that people detect embarrassment <i>before </i>you blush. Apparently, blushing takes between fifteen and twenty seconds to reach its peak, yet most people need less than five seconds to recognize that someone is embarrassed\u2014they pick it up from the almost immediate shift in gaze, usually down and to the left, or from the sheepish, self-conscious grin that follows a half-second to a second later. So there's reason to doubt that the purpose of blushing is entirely expressive.</p><p>There is, however, an <b class=\"now\">alternative view</b> held by a growing number of scientists. The effect of intensifying embarrassment may not be incidental; perhaps that is what blushing is for. The notion isn't as absurd as it sounds. People may hate being embarrassed and strive not to show it when they are, but embarrassment serves an important good. For, unlike sadness or anger or even love, it is fundamentally a moral emotion. Arising from sensitivity to what others think, embarrassment provides notice that one has crossed certain bounds while at the same time providing others with a kind of apology. It keeps us in good standing in the world. And if blushing serves to heighten such sensitivity this may be to one's ultimate advantage.<br/></p>", "question": "20.

After studying the oxygen requirements of diving dolphins, she had carefully calculated that dives to 200 meters required 28% more oxygen than the animal could possibly inhale or have in reserve. Deep, prolonged dives might well be fatal. Yet in field experiments, somehow her subjects-trained bottlenose dolphins-easily plummeted to depths well below 200 meters and returned safely, with ample reserves of oxygen. After 5 years of arduous field experiments in the Pacific and Antarctic oceans, Williams and her colleagues finally discovered the diving dolphins' secret.</p><p>As she reports, rather than swimming\u2014and consuming oxygen\u2014all the way down, dolphins take a few strokes and then glide as long as possible, a trick bio-mechanicists call intermittent locomotion. By doing less work, the animals use less oxygen, and so can dive deeper and longer. This was quite a surprise, for dolphins and whales have been intensely studied for years and no one had any inkling that this diving behavior existed.</p><p>For decades researchers have emphasized steady-state locomotion, bringing organisms into the laboratory and watching them move at a steady pace. But Williams's finding is just one of a stream of recent results indicating that that focus was only a first step. The new work shows that animals from aquatic invertebrates to humans move like window shoppers, stopping and starting as they seek out food, mates, or shelter.</p><p><b class=\"now\">Probing the fitful nature of locomotion is helping researchers understand how various organisms' bodies and biochemistry are adapted for movement, and it may even have applications in human medicine.</b></p><p><b class=\"now\">For example, at a recent symposium organized by comparative physiologist Randi Weinstein, researchers compared notes and found that intermittent locomotion has surprising benefits for organisms-everything from allowing time to notice the surroundings to saving energy. In some respects human muscles appear to be more efficient when working intermittently than when working steadily, for example. This suggests better ways of helping people make the best use of their bodies, says Weinstein. \"By inserting rest and pauses, and changing the [exercise] interval, it might be possible to decrease the physiological load on the body [of] people with compromised systems,\" such as those recovering from heart problems, she says.</b></p><p><span>There are good reasons why researchers analyzing </span><span>locomotion previously concentrated on steady-state </span><span>experiments. Such analyses suited theorists, as model</span><span>ing the mechanics and energetics of steady movement is </span><span>more tractable than the mathematics of changing gaits </span><span>or repeated starts and stops. And designing effective </span><span>experiments in natural settings can be a challenge, says </span><span>Williams, who should know.</span></p><p><span>To solve the paradox of how marine mammals dive </span><span>so deeply, her team first had to develop or track down </span><span>technologies to monitor the animals as they swam. The </span><span>researchers coaxed a prosthetics manufacturer to make </span><span>a custom-molded plastic housing to fit over a dolphin's </span><span>dorsal fin, mounted a pressurized case containing cameras </span><span>on the plastic, and then stabilized the device with a </span><span>thin strap around the dolphin's belly. On some dives the </span><span>camera was mounted facing backward to view the </span><span>fluke, and other times it faced forward to view the flip</span><span>pers. Other sensors tracked depth, temperature, speed </span><span>and acceleration.</span></p><p><span>The videos revealed that a dolphin strokes with its </span><span>tail at the beginning of a dive, but then spends as much </span><span>as 2 minutes motionless. Intermittent swimming and </span><span>gliding continue for both the descent and the ascent </span><span>Weddell seals and blue whales have adopted this strat</span><span>egy too, Williams's team found. For dives of less than </span><span>50 meters, the seals stroked the whole way down, but to </span><span>go deeper, they did a series of strokes and glides.
