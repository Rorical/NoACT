Then we are running across the stone courtyard\u2014my sisters and I barefooted in cotton pajamas, the stones waxy beneath our feet. The neighbors and the street are all asleep, the buildings shut up, rose-tinted under a brassy, round moon. In one corner of the courtyard, tilted under the staircase to the upper floors, is the scooter, its red gleam muted now, private and soft. For a moment I think of my grandmother back in New Jersey, who wears a lipstick in the same fluid tones: red shot through with an undercurrent of blue. I look back at it as my parents open the car.</p><p>We drive through parts of the city that I\u2019ve never seen before, where the lights glow like melted butter and the girls on the sidewalks are wearing brimmed hats and high heels.

Then we race beyond the glowing streets\u2014they dwindle to a star\u2014and the road ahead of us is long and dusty blue and smells like a warm, blue must, like the heat of a sheep\u2019s back.</p><p>When we finally get out of the car, there\u2019s a gravel lot, an expanse of folding chairs, patios, sparkly restaurants wedged in a long crescent along a flat blackness like gleaming enamel. Dad holds his hand out toward the gleam. \u201cAnd what did I promise you kids?\u201d he asks, though I recall no promises related to anything like this. \u201cIt\u2019s the Dead Sea!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve come, as usual, with no preparation, so my parents let us run into the water in our underpants\u2014like theJordanian kids around us. The salt water is satiny, so soft and dense it seems to bend beneath our arms. My father, who is generally afraid of the water,comes out and shows us how you can sit in the sea. He lazes back in it, and my sister tows him around by his hair while he makes boat sounds.</p><p>One of the restaurants on the lip of the water has a string of red lights that drop their reflections in the moon lit water; they make me think of the lonely red scooter. After a while, I straggle out of the water, yanking up my soggy underpants with their sprung elastic waistband. Mom is stretched out on a canvas chaise longue, holding a drink with a little parasol on the side. She wraps me shivering into a beach towel and makes room for me beside her on the lounge.</p><p>I blink out of my towel cave at this new place around us, then touch my mother\u2019s ribs through her <span>cotton shirt. \"Mom, how long do you have to be best friends with someone if you're best friends?\"</span></p><p></p><p>She flitters at my bangs; they\u2019re drying stiff with salt. \u201cWell, honey, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any rules about that.

Then we are running across the stone courtyard\u2014my sisters and I barefooted in cotton pajamas, the stones waxy beneath our feet. The neighbors and the street are all asleep, the buildings shut up, rose-tinted under a brassy, round moon. In one corner of the courtyard, tilted under the staircase to the upper floors, is the scooter, its red gleam muted now, private and soft. For a moment I think of my grandmother back in New Jersey, who wears a lipstick in the same fluid tones: red shot through with an undercurrent of blue. I look back at it as my parents open the car.</p><p>We drive through parts of the city that I\u2019ve never seen before, where the lights glow like melted butter and the girls on the sidewalks are wearing brimmed hats and high heels. Men smile and turn to watch our car passing: I watch back, hands pressed to the window. Then we race beyond the glowing streets\u2014they dwindle to a star\u2014and the road ahead of us is long and dusty blue and smells like a warm, blue must, like the heat of a sheep\u2019s back.</p><p>When we finally get out of the car, there\u2019s a gravel lot, an expanse of folding chairs, patios, sparkly restaurants wedged in a long crescent along a flat blackness like gleaming enamel. Dad holds his hand out toward the gleam. \u201cAnd what did I promise you kids?\u201d he asks, though I recall no promises related to anything like this. \u201cIt\u2019s the Dead Sea!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve come, as usual, with no preparation, so my parents let us run into the water in our underpants\u2014like theJordanian kids around us. The salt water is satiny, so soft and dense it seems to bend beneath our arms. My father, who is generally afraid of the water,comes out and shows us how you can sit in the sea. He lazes back in it, and my sister tows him around by his hair while he makes boat sounds.</p><p>One of the restaurants on the lip of the water has a string of red lights that drop their reflections in the moon lit water; they make me think of the lonely red scooter. After a while, I straggle out of the water, yanking up my soggy underpants with their sprung elastic waistband. Mom is stretched out on a canvas chaise longue, holding a drink with a little parasol on the side. She wraps me shivering into a beach towel and makes room for me beside her on the lounge.</p><p>I blink out of my towel cave at this new place around us, then touch my mother\u2019s ribs through her <span>cotton shirt. \u201cMom, how long do you have to be best friends with someone if you\u2019re best friends?\u201d</span></p><p></p><p>She flitters at my bangs; they\u2019re drying stiff with salt. \u201cWell, honey, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any rules about that. I guess you can be best friends with someone your whole life if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you and Dad best friends?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to make out her expression under the cherry lights. She seems to be thinking about it, staring out to where Dad is still drifting around, piping and tooting like a tugboat.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do whatever your best friend says, right?\u201d</p><p>Now I can see her face\u2014amused and wary. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad said to come to Jordan,right?\u201d</p><p>There is even less sound now than before, if that is possible, just a slip of waves on the shore, a sighing wash like the sound of someone saying <i>hush</i>,<i>hush</i>, or the rustle of the palm fronds arching over the sand. \u201cYour father . . . needed us to come here, he needed to see\u2014what it felt like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d I ask quietly, not quite knowing what I\u2019m asking, just following the path of the questions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d she starts, then stops. My father is climbing out of the dark wash of the sea. \u201cI don\u2019t think it feels the way he remembers it.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on her waist\u2014something that feels a little like a spark of alarm bounces through me. \u201cDoes he know that?That it doesn\u2019t feel the same?\u201d</p><p>She looks over her shoulder, my father\u2019s shadow falling toward us in a long, cool slip as he walks beneath theneon lights. \u201cHe\u2019s still finding out.\u201d</p><p>The medicinal waters of the DeadSea roll behind us, and the wild, heavy scent of honey, rocks, and thyme tempers the air. People come to dip themselves in these waters, to be cured of everything from skin ailments to spiritual wasting. I breathe it in deeply and sense a sort of dawning sweetness\u2014of loss and nostalgia.</p><p>Reprinted by permission of The Joy Harris Literary Agency, Inc. </p>", "question": "10.

These neurons were first discovered in human brains in the nineteenth century and were named von Economo cells after the Romanian anatomist Constantin von Economo, who identified them. At first, these spindle-shaped neurons were touted as the cells that \u201cmake us human,\u201d because they\u2019re connected to our feelings of empathy, love, emotional suffering, and sociality. Then, in 1999, two other researchers, Patrick Hof and John Allman, spotted von Economo cells in the brains of all the great apes; others recently found them in monkeys. Allman has searched without luck for the cells in more than a hundred other species, from sloths to platypuses. So it was big news when, in 2007, he discovered spindle cells in the brains of whales, dolphins, and elephants. But it was a puzzling discovery, too. Why should such a disparate group of animals have these specialized cells?</p><p>From an evolutionary point of view, it\u2019s not surprising that primates and humans have von Economo cells, since we are in the same lineage. But primates and humans haven\u2019t shared an ancestor with whales or elephants since about the beginning of the mammalian lineage, some sixty million years ago. It seems that cetaceans and elephants evolved their spindle cells independently. What factors would produce such emotionally specialized brain cells?</p><p>Allman thinks part of the answer lies in the size of the animals\u2019 brains\u2014most species that have spindle cells also have notably large brains\u2014and in the location of the cells. Von Economo cells are always found in two regions of the cortex associated with emotionally charged, visceral judgments, such as deciding whether a fellow animal is suffering. And part of the answer lies in the size of the spindle cells. They are unusually large, enabling them to act like high-speed circuits, fast-tracking information to and from other parts of the brain, while bypassing unnecessary connections. These are the kind of cells, Allman argues, that would be especially useful to an animal living in a complex society\u2014a society in which making accurate, intuitive decisions about another\u2019s actions (or facial or vocal expressions) is crucial for your family\u2019s and your survival.</p><p>Passage B by Carl Safina</p><p><i>Anthropomorphism</i> is the attribution of human motivation, characteristics, or behavior to animals, inanimate objects, or natural phenomena.</p><p>In establishing the study of animal behavior as a science, it had originally been helpful to make <i>anthropomorphism</i> a word that raised a red flag.
