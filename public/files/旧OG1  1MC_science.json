Use of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> is controversial because studies have linked NO2- with cancer. Students performed 2 experiments to measure NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> levels.<br/><br/><i>Experiment 1<br/></i><br/>     Four solutions, each containing a different amount of N<sub>a</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> (a salt) in H<sub>2</sub>O were prepared. A coloring agent was added that binds with NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> to form a purple compound that strongly absorbs light of a specific wavelength, and each solution was diluted to 100 mL. A <i>blank</i> solution was prepared in the same manner, but no N<sub>a</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> was added. A <i>colorimeter</i> (a device that measures how much light of a selected wavelength is absorbed by a sample) was used to measure the <i>absorbance </i>of each solution. The absorbances were corrected by subtracting the absorbance of the blank solution from each reading (see Table 1 and Figure 1).</p><p><img height=\"296.05\" src=\"https://ame-1253155612.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/223b1e039f73db29bafdbdd475cda88d\" width=\"383.8\"/><br/></p><p><img height=\"312.59\" src=\"https://ame-1253155612.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2234800d78d12e8098b6267cb94da965\" width=\"385\"/><br/></p><p><i>Experiment 2</i><br/><br/>     A 100 g meat sample was ground in a blender with 50 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O and the mixture was filtered. The blender and remaining meat were then washed with H<sub>2</sub>O, these washings were filtered, and the liquid was added to the sample solution. The coloring agent was added and the solution was diluted to 100 mL. The procedure was repeated for several meats, and the absorbances were measured (see Table 2).<br/></p><p><img src=\"https://ame-1253155612.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/fa049367ceda94df3c96149a66ead75d\" width=\"50%\"/><br/></p>", "question": "40. If some of the water-soluble contents found in all of the meats tested in Experiment 2 absorbed light of the same wavelength as the compound formed with NO2- and the coloring agent, how would the measurements have been affected?
