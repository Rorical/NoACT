But at my home high in the mountains of Colorado, I've started to approach it as an art. The frequent snowstorms that roll through the area <b>gives</b> me many chances to refine my shoveling technique.<br/><br/>[1] I think <b>only of</b> the six inches of fresh powder that fell overnight, but of the accumulation of snow that will fall over the entire season. [2] In early November, when winter's first storm <b>hits;</b> I start by putting the task in perspective. [3] I used to shovel just enough to free my car. [4] Now, as I work in my fifty-yard driveway, I shovel the first snowfall into <b>mounds that will become</b> the structural base for my creative winter work. [5]</p><p>My goal is to create something like a sculpture as the snow piles up. By establishing a pattern early, I can ensure the accumulation grows artfully as the season continues. Even though I enjoy snow, I think summer is my favorite season. [6] With each successive snowfall, and each additional hour I spend shoveling, the first small mounds become graceful, curving snowbanks that bury the split rail fence and eventually inch above my head. I appreciate how each <b>year; the sculpture is different,</b> a new design with each new winter.<br/><br/>Nature is my partner in this art. Periodic thawing of the snow causes my piles to slump a bit, <b>and besides,</b> the snow freezes again when temperatures <b>drop, turning</b> the surface of the formations into thick, packed ice. The high winds that drive late February storms carve my icy snowbanks into fantastic, swirling shapes and smooth the rough work <b>of my shovel, whose work is carved by the wind.</b> When the sun emerges, the two walls lining my driveway dazzle the eye with <b>their</b> glitter.<br/><br/>Several people in my area have their <b>driveway's</b> cleared by a pickup truck with a plow mounted <b>where it is anchored</b> on its front. It's less work, but the piles in front of their houses seem awkward and sloppy.</p><p>I prefer my polished snowbanks, <b class=\"now\">their temporary beauty</b> heightened for me by my understanding that, come spring, they will be reduced to little more than mud.</p>", "question": "14.
