I was a senior in high school, gunning to qualify for the USA Junior Nationals. The previous summer I had missed the cut by less than a second in the mile, and just the day before, at my high school regional meet, I had come within three-tenths of a second in the 500-yard freestyle. The qualification time was 4:39.69; I swam a 4:39.95. The next day, Sunday, I drove with my mother to the far side of Houston where a time trial was being held\u2014an informal, unadvertised event thrown together at the last minute. The only races swum were those the swimmers requested to swim. Most were short, flapping sprints in which swimmers attempted to shave off a few one-hundredths of a second. I didn\u2019t have the courage to face the mile, and since I\u2019d struck out in the 500 the day before, I decided to swim the 1,000-yard freestyle. Forty lengths of the pool. It was a race I\u2019d swum fast enough to believe that given the right confluence of circumstances\u2014cold  water, an aggressive heat, an energetic meet\u2014I could make the cut, I had fifteen seconds to drop to qualify. </p><p>By the time I stood up on the blocks, I was not only the only one in the race, I was practically the only one in the natatorium. The horn sounded and I dove in. I was angry and disheartened at having missed the cut the day before and I had little belief that I could go any faster today. </p><p>About six hundred yards in, my coach started to pace. I stayed steady on, not in a hurry, not about to get my hopes up. In my mind, I had already missed the time. Then a boy from a rival high school, whom I hardly knew, unfolded his legs and climbed down from the bleachers and started to cheer. He squatted low to the water and pointed his finger toward the end of the pool, as if to say, <i>That\u2019s where you\u2019re going</i>, <i>now hurry up.</i> I thought, <i>If he\u2019s cheering, maybe I\u2019m close. </i></p><p>Sometimes a moment comes along when the world slows down, and though everything else moves around us at the same frenetic speed, we\u2019re afforded the opportunity to reflect in real-time rather than in retrospect. It is as though we slip into a worm-hole in the fabric of time and space, travel into the past and then back again to the present in the same instant. That morning, swimming, I remembered a day in late September the year before, the last day my swim team had use of an outdoor pool. All summer long my teammates and I swam under an open sky. After this day we would spend the rest of the season in a dank and moldy indoor pool. </p><p>The triangular backstroke flags were strung across the lanes and the adjacent diving well. My teammates liked to run down the long cement deck, jump out over the diving well, and try to grab hold of the line. Many of them could jump far enough to make it.

I squared up and ran, my feet wet against the pavement, and just as my foot hit the water\u2019s edge, one of my teammates called out \u201cJump!\u201d I bent my knees and pushed off hard and got my hand around the flag line.

Climbing up the Zailijskei Alatau slopes of the Tian Shan mountains separating Kazakhstan from China, Vavilov found <b class=\"now\">thickets</b> of wild apples <b class=\"now\">stretching in every direction</b>, an <b class=\"now\">extensive forest</b> of fruit coloured russet red, creamy yellow, and vibrant pink. Nowhere else in the world do apples grow thickly as a forest or with such incredible diversity. Amazed by what he saw, Vavilov wrote: \u2018I could see with my own eyes that I had stumbled upon the centre of origin for the apple.\u2019 </p><p>With extraordinary prescience and few facts, Vavilov suggested that the wild apples he had seen growing in the Tian Shan were in fact the ancestors of the modern apple. He tracked the whole process of domestication to the mountains near Alma-Ata, where the wild apples looked awfully similar to the apples found at the local grocery. Unfortunately, Vavilov\u2019s theory would remain mostly unknown for decades. </p><p>Exactly where the apple came from had long been a matter of contention and discussion among people who study plant origins. Vavilov, imprisoned by Joseph Stalin in 1940 for work in plant genetics that challenged Stalin\u2019s beliefs, died in a Leningrad prison in 1943. Only after the fall of communism in Russia did Vavilov\u2019s theory, made more than half a century earlier, become widely recognized. </p><p>As Vavilov predicted, it\u2019s now believed that all of the apples known today are direct descendents of the wild apples that evolved in Kazakhstan. Apples do not comprise all of Kazakhstan\u2019s plant bounty, however. At least 157 other plant species found in Kazakhstan are either direct precursors or close wild relatives of domesticated crops, including 90 per cent of all cultivated temperate fruits. The name of Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, Alma-Ata, or Almaty as it is known today, even translates as \u2018Father of Apples\u2019 or, according to some, \u2018where the apples are\u2019. So this news about the apple\u2019s origins was probably no surprise to residents, particularly in towns where apple seedlings are known to grow up through the cracks in the pavements. The apple has been evolving in Central Asia for upwards of 4.5 million years. </p><p>Passage B by Gary Nabhan </p><p>Nikolai Vavilov is widely regarded as the world\u2019s greatest plant explorer, for he made over 250,000 seed, fruit, and tuber collections on five continents. Kazakh conservationist Tatiana Salova credits him with first recognizing that Kazakhstan was the center of origin and diversity for apples. \u201cIt is not surprising,\u201c she concedes, \u201cthat when Vavilov first came to Kazakhstan to look at plants he was so amazed. Nowhere else in the world do apples grow as a forest. That is one reason why he stated that this is probably where the apple was born, this was its birthing grounds.\u201d </p><p>Discerning where a crop originated and where the greatest portion of its genetic diversity remains extant may seem esoteric to the uninitiated. But knowing where exactly our food comes from\u2014geographically, culturally, and genetically\u2014is of paramount importance to the rather small portion of our own species that regularly concerns itself with the issue of food security. The variety of foods that we keep in our fields, orchards, and, secondarily, in our seed banks is critically important in protecting our food supply from plagues, crop diseases, catastrophic weather, and political upheavals, Vavilov himself was personally motivated to become an agricultural scientist by witnessing several famines during the czarist era of Russia. He hoped that by combining a more diverse seed portfolio with knowledge from both traditional farmers and collaborating scientists, the number of Russian families suffering from hunger might be reduced. </p><p>In a very real sense, the forests of wild foragers and the orchards of traditional farmers in such centers of crop diversity are the wellsprings of diversity that plant breeders, pathologists, and entomologists return to every time our society whittles the resilience in our fields and orchards down to its breaking point. </p><p>And whittle away we have done. Here in North America, according to apple historian Dan Bussey, some 16,000 apple varieties have been named and nurtured over the last four centuries. By 1904, however, the identities and sources of only 7,098 of those varieties could be discerned by USDA scientist W. H. Ragan. Since then, some 6,121 apple varieties\u201486.2 percent of Ragan\u2019s 1904 inventory\u2014have been lost from nursery catalogs, farmers\u2019 markets, and from the American table.</p>", "question": "11.

Climbing up the Zailijskei Alatau slopes of the Tian Shan mountains separating Kazakhstan from China, Vavilov found thickets of wild apples stretching in every direction, an extensive forest of fruit coloured russet red, creamy yellow, and vibrant pink. Nowhere else in the world do apples grow thickly as a forest or with such incredible diversity.

He tracked the whole process of domestication to the mountains near Alma-Ata, where the wild apples looked awfully similar to the apples found at the local grocery. Unfortunately, Vavilov\u2019s theory would remain mostly unknown for decades. </p><p>Exactly where the apple came from had long been a matter of contention and discussion among people who study plant origins. Vavilov, imprisoned by Joseph Stalin in 1940 for work in plant genetics that challenged Stalin\u2019s beliefs, died in a Leningrad prison in 1943. Only after the fall of communism in Russia did Vavilov\u2019s theory, made more than half a century earlier, become widely recognized. </p><p>As Vavilov predicted, it\u2019s now believed that all of the apples known today are direct descendents of the wild apples that evolved in Kazakhstan. Apples do not comprise all of Kazakhstan\u2019s plant bounty, however.

The coupling isn\u2019t enough to prove cause and effect by itself, but it\u2019s solid circumstantial evidence that the interaction of the Sagittarius Dwarf with the Milky Way disk created the warp in our galaxy.</p>", "question": "40.
