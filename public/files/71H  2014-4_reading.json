As </span><span>expected, the orange did not grow to be very big or </span><span>seem very succulent, but it did begin to hang rather </span><span>heavily. And when the salty wind blew west from the </span><span>sea rocking it back and forth like a small cradle the </span><span>curious line\u2014now running through the growing </span><span>orange\u2014rocked back and forth with it like a lullaby.</span></p><p>Rafaela and her son Sol walked hand in hand past the orange tree, careful not to disturb the lizards and beetles waiting breathlessly beneath scattered leaves and brush. For three days now, it had not rained. And yet any cool surface bled the air's moisture. Rafaela felt this wetness; it gathered in tiny molecules over her skin. It was a little before noon, and the sun was particularly bright and oppressive that day. If Rafaela had bothered to look at the calendar, she would have noticed that it was Monday, June 22. She might have also noticed the lunar signs in the corner of the calendar and the small print that said summer solstice.</p><p>She glanced briefly at the orange with some satisfaction and hurried toward the house. \"Come on Sol. It's much too hot out here today.\" His little quick steps pattered behind, dancing around the young trees, and then ran forward. She followed Sol who seemed to be following a path of his own, but upon closer inspection, he was tracing the path of a very thin but distinct shadow stretched in a perfectly straight line along the dirt and sand. There were no telephone cables or electric lines above, nothing to cast such a shadow and yet it was clearly there. Rafaela glanced back toward the orange tree and the single orange, suddenly aware of the only possible and yet entirely impossible thing that could obstruct the intensity of the sun's light at this hour, slicing the heavy atmosphere with cruel precision. Indeed the sun was a great ball of fire directly above the orange tree . It seemed even to point at the tree, at the strange line, at the orange itself.</p><p>Rafaela ran after Sol into the cool shadows of the house. There was a sudden gust of tepid wind, and from the corner of her eye, she thought she saw the line's razor shadow dip away, south. Rafaela felt a dizzy nausea.

There were no telephone cables or electric lines above, nothing to cast such a shadow and yet it was clearly there. Rafaela glanced back toward the orange tree and the single orange, suddenly aware of the only possible and yet entirely impossible thing that could obstruct the intensity of the sun's light at this hour, slicing the heavy atmosphere with cruel precision.

Carbon dioxide is a so-called greenhouse gas. It traps sunlight close to the Earth, raising the planet's temperature. Less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means colder weather.</p><p>But why did carbon dioxide levels fall? The leading theory is because two of the Earth's tectonic plates collided, forming the Himalayas. </p><p>Marine geologist Maureen Raymo, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, worked out a scenario that is widely cited in the scientific literature\u2014both favorably and not. Raymo noted that theHimalayas are taller than any other mountain range on Earth and that they formed at nearly the same time as the start of the ice ages. Scientists realize that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with rain to make an acid that erodes rock; in the process, minerals such as calcium silicate in the rocks react with carbon dioxide, removing the gas from the atmosphere. Therefore, erosion on slopes as vast as the Himalayas', says Raymo, could reduce carbon dioxide levels enough to give the ice ages a push.</p><p>Raymo acknowledges that her idea has holes. Weathering on the scale she theorizes would devour so much carbon dioxide that soon there wouldn't be any left at all. Other scientists point to an opposite problem: The kind of minerals in the Himalayan rocks rarely consume carbon dioxide when they erode. The mystery of Cenozoic cooling has encouraged researchers to propose many other candidate culprits. One recent scientific paper theorizes that the key factor is the tons of sediment shed by the mountains every year. The sediment runs into the Indian Ocean and buries large amounts of marine plankton and other plants .Entombed along with the plants is their carbon dioxide, meaning less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and therefore less warming. Solutions championed by other scientists include the evolution of grasses, which happened at roughly the right time and would have stored large amounts of carbon dioxide in the soil; and weathering of the mountains in either New Guinea br Siberia.</p><p>There is equally great bafflement over the much more recent Northern Hemisphere glaciations. For most of the Cenozoic Ice Age, the polar regions were the only place to suffer heavy invasions of ice. But 2.5 million Y.ears ago, glaciers moved into Europe and North America and have paid regular visits since. Scientists can explain the <i>timing </i>of these local ice ages. As the Earth's orbit slowly changes, so does the pattern of the sunlight .falling on a given spot on the globe, triggering the glaciers' advance and retreat. The problem is that the orbital changes are not big enough to make or to melt ice sheets.</p><p>What ice age scholars need are cold, hard data. For example, there are no direct measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide beyond 200,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide levels are revealed by long cylinders of Ice extracted from Antarctica. But there is no ice old enough to reveal the composition of the atmosphere millions of years ago.</p><p>\"Information is pouring in now, and it is not converging on a simple explanation,\" says Isaac Winograd, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey. </p><p>Until scientists can explain changes in Earth's climatic past, they cannot be sure they aren't overlooking factors that could either counteract a human-made warming\u2014or amplify it.</p>", "question": "40.
