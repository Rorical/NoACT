For weeks I was preoccupied with and vexed myself over what my father and I would possibly talk about for seven days and seven night, constantly being together and sharing each meal, sleeping in the same house day in, day out, after our years of estrangement sealed by an impromptu reconciliation.

My father stands off to the side, nervously awaiting his turn, large, rugged, callused hands thrust deep inside into his pants pocket, as he psyches himself up for a fleeting, ephemeral moment of intimacy with another adult male. Surprising me, he locks me in an embrace that is both macho and compassionate and he doesn't let go first, which is foreign to me since I can count, on one hand, the paucity of occasions when my father has embraced me; and in his touch I can feel, almost palpably, his gratification in seeing his firstborn for the first time since two Christmases ago. Before leaving the terminal, Delores insists upon taking a photo of us, father and son, day one of the arrival, my arm wrapped around him and the rigidity of his pose, the tightening of his muscles and the tautness of his spine, that won't be captured by the camera's aperture and recorded on the celluloid.</p><p>As I leave the airport terminal, my father and Delores exchange gut-level reactions and first impressions of Los Angeles, my father in the front seat and Delores in the back. My father leans over and switches on the radio, predictably, frantically searching the dial for the local jazz station. His horrified expression freezes as I explain, in the apologetic tone of a parent informing the child that the ice-cream vendor won't be coming today, that Los Angeles' only jazz station is now defunct. But I believe, I say quickly, in an effort to smooth out the wrinkles in his face, that there\u201cis another noncommercial broadcast from one of the local universities. His radar ever intact, he finds the broadcast. His fingers stop moving only when the dial slides into Miles Davis's muted horn blaring out at us. The disc jockey is spinning a recent composition. My father and I inhale deeply, both of us immediately recognizing the signature horn, pretending we don't, my foot and fingers tapping to the rhythm of genius, as we consciously sidestep the potential argument we engage in from time to time regarding the merit of Miles\u2019s contemporary contributions. My father, jazz elitist and purist, firmly and unequivocally and inexorably theorize that the legendary horn blower has done absolutely nothing musically worthwhile recently. He sold out, my father upholds. He's growing, I contradict, we can't and shouldn't expect him to repeat what he did in the fifties and sixties.</p><p>Studying my father at red lights and through intermittent glances that punctuate our conversation. I realize, understand, and accept, as I never have before, that he is indeed aging. Still remarkably handsome, even dashing for his middle age, his silky hair, short and black and wavy and parted at the side as it was the day he married my mother at age twenty, is his sole physical attribute that remains timeless. When I became a teenager, then segued into young adulthood, the maturation of my growth having kicked in, shaping and molding the adult face through which I would see the world, a face that that would pretty much stay the same forever and always, people began physically comparing me and my father, a comparison it took me awhile to get used to.

The government's guide to finding the edge of a swamp is fifty pages long, complete with graphs and soil maps you need a magnifying glass to decipher. But a liquid landscape cannot be nailed down with maps and charts any more than love can be understood as a biochemical reaction of pheromones.</p><p>Trying to define the edge of a swamp is like trying to put a neatly folded shadow into a dresser drawer. Our efforts to outline these places arise from a desire for tidiness, a wish that nothing undefined lurk around our own edges. But the truth is, even human boundaries shift. Some mornings, I wake up feeling small and compact. I barrel through those days, teaching, opening mail, and grading papers like a self-propelled lawn mower. Other days, I feel huge, airy, globular. Someone blows through the bubble wand, and I billow out my front door, roll into the garden, into class. I can't grade a thing, but I can see the shadow a poem makes, where it wants to go. On those days, I can live with how the edges of a swamp shift, how its underbelly can sometimes surge in the center and open up into a pond, how the pond can disappear and the woods around the perimeter go soggy overnight.</p><p>Once, as children, my twin sister and I fashioned our own seedpod by threading an old rope through the four corner grommets of a tarpaulin and flinging the rope's frayed end over a large limb of a maple in front of the house. We sat cross-legged in the middle of the tarp and pulled on the rope until the four corners rose around us, enclosing us, and the sack began to rise off the ground, we were actually able to hoist ourselves a few feet into the air this way and dangle there, a khaki-green sack of twins, a pod hanging heavy on the vine, its seeds hidden inside, suspended and swaying over the front lawn of a suburban neighborhood.</p><p>At that time, my family lived just a half mile or so from a small pond. One spring I spend weeks there imaging my stick was a giant pencil with a pink rubber eraser on the end. I imagined crouching on the bank of the pond and systematically erasing the edge. There was something quite magical about the notion that you could change the ground  you stood on by erasing some line.</p><p>The gift of ambiguity is that it stretches us. Makes us less rigid. Nudges us out of either/or thinking. One morning when I was forty-two, I stood in my bedroom, changing from a sweat shirt to a T-shirt, and suddenly I couldn't remember whether my twin or I was older. Was I Baby Girl A or Baby Girl B? From the moment of our birth, in spite of our parents' best efforts to differentiate us, we were \"the twins,\" a unit who shared bedrooms and friends and chores and clothes and good-night rituals, a unit others momentarily dissected by asking which of us was older, as if those thirteen minutes were the only distinction between us. So, on the midlife morning when I stood in my bedroom and felt those thirteen minutes utterly dissolve, the realization swept over me that if I didn't know which one of us was older, if that distinction disappeared, then I might very well be my sister, not me. Looking in the mirror didn't help. I recognized the face, knew this body was the writer's and that other one the designer's.
