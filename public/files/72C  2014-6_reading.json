But for a few lonely oceanic islands, the unperturbed surface offers no hint of the grand and sweeping energies hidden below. </p><p>Only one thousand miles offshore, the <i>Cramer</i> has  already sailed through some of Atlantic\u2019s deepest waters. Contrary to what one might guess, Atlantic\u2019s deepest waters, like those in other oceans, are along her edges. As we continue east, toward the middle of the sea, the bottom rises. The unmarked plains of the abyss,  here flattened by layers of sediment, give way to rising foothills and then to mountains. The first maps of Atlantic seafloor noted, albeit crudely, this rise. Early efforts to plumb Atlantic\u2019s depths proved outrageously inaccurate: one naval officer paid out eight miles (thirteen kilometers) of hemp rope from a drifting ship and concluded the sea had no bottom. Eventually, sailors more or less successfully calculated depth by heaving overboard cannonballs tied to bailing twine. When they hit bottom, the sailors measured and snipped the twine  and then moved on, leaving a trail of lead strung out across the seafloor. These crude soundings, forming the basis of the first map of Atlantic\u2019s basin, published in 1854, identified a prominent rise halfway between Europe and America. </p><p>For many years no one could explain why the basin of Atlantic, unlike a bowl, deepened at its edges and shoaled in its center. People assumed that this \u201cMiddle Ground,\u201d \u201cTelegraph Plateau,\u201d or \u201cDolphin Rise,\u201d as it was variously called, was an ancient and drowned land bridge, or a lost continent, but sailors repairing transatlantic telegraph cable unknowingly produced evidence to prove otherwise. Wrestling with the broken cable, they accidentally twisted off a piece of the \u201cplateau\u201d and dredged up a twenty-one-pound  (ten-kilogram) chunk of dense black volcanic rock. It was some of the youngest, freshest rock on earth, and it was torn not from a piece of continent sunk beneath the waves, but from the very foundation of the sea. </p><p>Today, highly sophisticated sound waves bring the  hazy images of those early soundings into sharp focus, revealing that one of the largest and most salient geographic features on the planet lies on the floor of the ocean. Hidden beneath the waves is an immense submerged mountain range, the backbone of the sea. More  extensive, rugged, and imposing than the Andes, Rockies, or Himalayas, it covers almost as much of earth\u2019s surface as the dry land of continents. Winding like the seam of a baseball, it circles the planet in a long, sinuous path, running the entire length of Atlantic, slashing  the basin neatly in two. Its mountains are stark and black, as black as the sea itself, lit only at their peaks by a thin, patchy covering of white, the skeletal remains of tiny microscopic animals that once lived at the surface. Peaks as high as Mount St. Helens sit in a watery  world of blackness, more than a mile below the surface, beyond the reach of light, beyond the sight of sailors. </p><p>A great valley, eclipsing any comparable feature on dry land, runs through these mountains. Arizona\u2019s Grand Canyon, one of earth\u2019s most spectacular places,  extends for about 280 miles (450 kilometers). A lesser-known canyon of similar depth but considerably greater length lies hidden in the mountains of the ridge. Although offset in many places by breaks in the mountains, the rift valley, as the canyon is called, extends the  length of Atlantic for 11,000 miles (17,700 kilometers). Here in this bleak and forbidding place, where the water is almost, freezing, subterranean fires have lifted mounds of fresh lava onto the seafloor. Scientists visiting the rift valley for the first time named the volcanic  hills in this otherworldly setting after distant, lifeless planets. </p><p>Yet, what had seemed so foreign to scientists is an integral part of earth\u2019s very being, for at the ridge our own planet gives birth. The floor of the rift valley is  torn; from the gashes has sprung the seafloor underlying all of Atlantic. Here the youngest, newest pieces are made. Earth is still cooling from her tumultuous birth four and a half billion years ago. Heat, leaking from the molten core and from radioactive decay deep inside the  planet,  rises toward earth\u2019s surface, powering the volcanoes that deliver the ridge to the sea.</p>", "question": "11.

A team of biomechanists has studied the incredibly speedy bite of a group of Central and South American ants. The team  clocked the bite as the fastest on the planet\u2014and discovered that it also gives the ants the unique ability to jump with their jaws, adding to an impressive array of already known defenses. </p><p>Trap-jaw ants nest in leaf litter, rather than underground or in mounds. There they often feed on well-armored and elusive prey, including other species of ants. As they stalk their dinner, the trap-jaws hold their mandibles wide apart, often cocked open at 180 degrees or more by a latch mechanism. When minute trigger  hairs on the inner edge of the mandible come in contact with something, the jaws snap shut at speeds now known to reach 145 miles per hour. No passerby could outrace that. The astoundingly high speed gives the jaws, despite their light weight, enough force to crack  open the armor of most prey and get at the tasty meat inside. </p><p>The key to the jaws\u2019 speed (and their even more amazing acceleration) is that the release comes from stored energy produced by the strong but slow muscles  of the jaw. Think how an archer slowly draws an arrow in a bowstring against the flex of a bow: nearly all the energy from the archer\u2019s muscles pours into the flexing of the bow. When released, the energy stored in the bow wings the arrow toward its target much faster than the  archer could by throwing the arrow like a javelin. The biomechanics of energy storage is the domain of Sheila N. Patek and Joseph E. Baio, both biomechanists at the University of california, Beykdey. They teamed up with two ant experts, Brian L. Fisher of the California  Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and Andrew V. Suarez of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to look at the trap-jaw ant <i>Odontomachus bauri</i>. </p><p>Fisher, Suarez, and other field biologists had  already noted that catching <i>O. bauri</i> was like grabbing for popping popcorn\u2014and very hot popcorn at that, because a painful sting goes with an ant\u2019s trap-jaw bite. The insects bounced around in a dizzying frenzy and propelled themselves many times their body length  when biologists or smaller intruders approached them. Patek and Baio made high-speed video image of their movements, and discovered that the secret of their self-propulsion was the well-executed \u201cfiring\u201d of their mandibles. They also observed that mandibles started to  decelerate before they meet\u2014possibly to avoid self-inflicted damage. Most important, the ants had two distinct modes of aerial locomotion. </p><p>In the so-called escape jump, an ant orients its head and jaws perpendicular to the ground, then slams  its face straight down. That triggers the cocked mandibles to release with a force 400 times the ant\u2019s body weight, launching the insect ten or more body lengths nearly straight into the air. The ant doesn\u2019t seem to go in any particular direction, but the jump is  presumably fast and unpredictable enough to help the insect evade, say, the probing tongue of a lizard. Not only can the jumping ant gain height and sow confusion, but it may also get to a new vantage point from which to relaunch an attack. </p><p>The second kind of jaw-propelled locomotion is even more common than escape jumping. If an intruder enters the ants\u2019 nest, one of the ants bangs its jaws against the intruder, which triggers the trap-jaw and propels the interloper (if small enough) in one  direction, out of the nest, and the ant in the other.
