But it was her son Akash who brought out a side of her father that surprised Ruma most. In the evenings her father stood beside her in the bathroom as she gave Akash his bath, scrubbing the caked on dirt from his elbows and knees. He helped put on his pajamas, brush his teeth, and comb back his soft damp hair.

Then again, perhaps they would hire someone to do the job. He would have preferred to put in vegetables, but they required more work than flowers. It was it modest planting, some slow-growing myrtle and phlox under the trees, two azalea bushes, a row of hostas, a clematis to climb one of the posts of the porch, and in honor of his wife, a small hydrangea.

In eighteenth-century Europe, many scientists believed in transmutation. They thought, for instance, that water could be transmuted into earth, among other things. Chief among the evidence for this was water boilIng in a pot. Solid residue forms on the inside surface. Scientists proclaimed this to be water turning into a new element. Robert Boyle, the great seventeenth-century British chemist and physicist who flourished a hundred years before Lavoisier, believed in transmutation. Having watched plants grow by soaking up water, he concluded, as many had before him, that water can be transformed into leaves, flowers, and berries. In the words of chemist Harold Goldwhite, of California State University, Los Angeles, \"Boyle was an active alchemist.\"</b></p><p>Lavoisier noticed that weight was the key, and that measurement was critical. He poured distilled water into a special \"tea kettle\" called a pelican, an enclosed pot with a spherical cap, which caught the water vapor and returned it to the base of the pot via two handlelike tubes. He boiled the water for 101 days and found substantial residue. He weighed the water, the residue, and the pelican. The water weighed exactly <span>the same. The p</span><span>elican weighed slightly less, an amount equal to the w</span><span>eight of the residue. Thus, the residue was not a trans</span><span>mutation, but part of the pot\u2014dissolved glass, silica, </span><span>and other matter.</span></p><p><span>As scientists continued to believe that water was a </span><span>basic element, Lavoisier performed another crucial </span><span>experiment. He invented a device with two nozzles and </span><span>squirted different gases from one into the other, to see w</span><span>hat they made. One day, he mixed oxygen with hydrogen, expecting to get acid. He got water.

Water always yielded oxygen and hydrogen in </span><span>a weight proportion of 8 to 1. What Lavoisier saw was that nature paid strict attention to weight and proportio</span><span>n.
