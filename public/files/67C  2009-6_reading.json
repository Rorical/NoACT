A luthier is a maker of\nstringed musical instruments.\n</i></span></p><p><span>The Amazonian Workshop School for Fabrication\nof Stringed Instruments (OELA) is a small part of a\nlarger effort to create a sustainable harvest of the great\nAmazon forest and to give employment to the region's </span><span>burgeoning population.</span></p><p><span>\"Few people know that the Amazon is one of the\nmost rapidly urbanizing regions of the world,\" observes\nJose\u0301 Gabriel Lo\u0301pez, a Ford Foundation program officer\nin Brazil. The city of Manaus, for example, has grown </span><span>in the past decade from 850,000 to 1.5 million. \"This\nrural-urban migration and the resultant urban shanty-towns stand as living symbols of failed or nonexistent\nrural development policies,\" Lo\u0301pez says. \"In many\nplaces, small-scale rural producers have been aban</span><span>doned\u2014devoid of health and education services, credit,\ntechnical assistance and opportunity. What Rubens\nGomes, founder of the workshop school, and his colleagues have created in Manaus is hope.\"</span></p><p><span>Gomes knows how to build hope. The school, he\n</span><span>notes proudly, is the first to make stringed instruments\nin the Amazon. And it is the first in all of the Americas\nto construct instruments exclusively of lumber harvested in an environmentally and socially sustainable </span><span>manner certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.</span></p><p><span>\"Officially, there are 30 million cubic meters of\nwood cut in the Amazon annually,\" Gomes says. \"Twenty million of this is wasted\u2014sawdust, scraps,\nunwanted wood left to rot. And those are the official\nnumbers. The motive of this school is to transform what </span><span>is lost into things of value. Many people could do\nthis\u2014but there are no schools teaching carpentry in the\nAmazon.\"</span></p><p><span>OELA is meant to help fill the void. To graduate,\neach student must make a stringed instrument. All the\n</span><span>guitars are made from certified wood. Gomes explains\nthat traditionally, Brazilian rosewood and ebony were\nused in the construction of guitars. But because of\nintense harvesting, these trees are close to extinction. \"I've been working for years, trying to find Amazon\n</span><span>woods that are unknown on the market, that are in plentiful supply and that can be used in instrument\nmaking,\" Gomes says. He experimented with dozens\nbefore he found types that have the right strength and\nsound. (Like other master luthiers, he can tell by touch</span><span>ing the wood whether it will reverberate well.) Once he\nidentified the woods as possible substitutes, he sent\nthem to a laboratory to be tested for the right grain and\ndensity. Today, Brosimum rubescens is substituted for\nrosewood, Aniba canellila for ebony, and Protium\n</span><span>species for Brazilian mahogany and cedar. These and </span><span>some 25 other undervalued tropical hardwoods have\nfound their way into the luthiers' workshop, taking the\npressure off the better-known woods.</span></p><p><span>For the past year, master luthier Rau\u0301l Lage from\n</span><span>the Fernando Ortiz Instrument-Making School of the\nCuban Music Institute has been working with the students. There are hurdles, he cautions, a number of them\ntechnical. The high humidity in Manaus means that the\nwood will crack in drier climates unless properly\n</span><span>treated. Glue frequently doesn't hold. These problems </span><span>are slowly being resolved.</span></p><p><span>There is also a major obstacle outside the workshop: The resistance of buyers to new woods. Thus far,\nmost of the instruments have been sold to environmen</span><span>talists, some of whom \"adopt\" a student by paying his\nor her tuition; the student's \"project guitar\" is then\ngiven to the donor as a gift.</span></p><p><span>There is also the possibility of contract work from\noutside the Amazon.

I came from an academically disinclined background in the northeast of England, my relatives being mainly coalminers and other manual workers. I </span><span>was the first in my family to attend university, and indeed had no thought of it until age 17, when a teacher mentioned it at school. My father had become a successful builder, so we were not materially deprived, and it was expected that I would become some sort of tech</span><span>nical worker. The idea that I might one day become a professional philosopher was inconceivable in those days, to me and everyone else. I was simply not living in a place where that kind of thing ever happened; it was far likelier\u2014though still not at all likely\u2014that I </span><span>would become a pop star (I played drums in a rock band).</span></p><p>The paperback British edition of my memoir <i>The Making of a Philosopher</i><span> </span>has a photograph on the cover of a man sitting on a bench, placed in a grey and listless <span>landscape. He is overlooking the sea on a misty grim day, and the atmosphere is bleak and melancholy. The man, hunched up, immobile, coiled almost, has a pensive posture, as if frozen in thought. This picture is based on a story I tell in the book about sitting on a </span><span>bench in Blackpool, aged 18, pondering the metaphysical question of how objects relate to their properties. Is an object just the sum total of its properties, a mere coalescence of general features, or does it somehow lie behind its properties, supporting them, a solid peg on </span><span>which they happen to hang? When I look at an object do I really see the object itself, or just the appearance its properties offer to me? I remember the feeling of fixation that came over me when I thought about these questions\u2014a kind of floating fascination, a still </span><span>perplexity.</span></p><p>When I look back on this period in my late teens, I recall the harnessing of undirected mental energy by intellectual pursuits. Up until then, my mental energy had gone into things like reading<span> </span>Melody Maker, which <span>contained fairly serious articles about pop musicians; I always knew the top 20 off by heart, and studied the articles about drummers intensely, hoping to improve my own technique. I suspect that this kind of swashing mental energy is fairly typical of boys that age. School </span><span>doesn\u2018t seem to connect with it, and it goes off in search of some object of interest, often trivial, sometimes destructive. In my case, it was philosophy that seized that energy and converted it into a passion\u2014 though one that took several years to form fully. It is a </span><span>delicate and fastidious energy that I am speaking of, despite its power, and it will only be satisfied by certain employments, which of course vary from person to person. I had had a similar passion for chemistry when </span><span>I was ten, and for butterflies and lizards before that.</span><span> </span><span>How to harness such passions to formal education </span><span>remains a great and unresolved problem.</span></p><p><span>It was\u2014of course\u2014a teacher who tapped into my formless and fizzing mental energy. Mr Marsh, teacher of divinity, brimmingly Christian, a man with very </span><span>active eyebrows and sharp enunciation, in love with scholarship (oh, how he relished that word)\u2014it was he who first brought out my inner philosopher. From him I heard of Descartes, locked up in his room, wondering whether anything could really be known beyond his </span><span>own existence. But what I mainly got from the enthusiastic Mr Marsh was the desire to study. His own passion for study shone through, and he managed to make it seem, if not glamorous, then at least exhilarating\u2014when done the right way and in the right spirit. Pencils </span><span>and stationery were made to seem like shiny tools, and the pleasure of making one\u2019s mark on a blank sheet of paper hymned. Choosing a good spot to study was emphasised. Above all, I learned a very valuable lesson, one that had hitherto escaped me: make notes. </span><span>Thinking and writing should be indissoluble activities, the hand ministering to the thought, the thought shaped by the hand.
