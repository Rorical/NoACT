The migration began before the birth of Christ. While Europeans were sailing close to the coastlines of continents before developing navigational instruments that would allow them to venture onto the open ocean, voyagers from Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa began to settle islands in ocean area of over 10 million square miles. The settlement took a thousand years to complete and involved finding and fixing in mind the position of islands, <b class=\"now\">sometimes less than a mile in diameter on which the highest landmark was a coconut tree.</b> By the time European explorers entered the Pacific Ocean in the 16th century almost all the habitable islands had been settled for hundreds of years. </span></p><p><span>The voyaging was all the more remarkable in that it was done in canoes built with tools of stone, bone, and coral. The canoes were navigated without instruments by expert seafarers who depended on their observations of the ocean and sky and traditional knowledge of the patterns of nature for clues to the direction and location of islands. The canoe hulls were dug out from tree trunks with adzes or made from planks sewn together with a cordage of coconut fiber twisted into strands and braided for strength. Cracks and seams were sealed with coconut fibers and sap from breadfruit or other trees. An outrigger was attached to a single hull for greater stability on the ocean; two hulls were lashed together with crossbeams and a deck added between the hulls to create double canoes capable of voyaging long distances. </span></p><p><span>The canoes were paddled when there was no wind and sailed when there was; the sails were woven from coconut or pandanus leaves. These vessels were seaworthy enough to make voyages of over 2,000 miles along the longest sea roads of Polynesia, such as the one between Hawai\u2019i and Tahiti. And though these double-hulled canoes had less carrying capacity than the broad-beamed ships of the European explorers, the Polynesian canoes were faster: one of English explorer Captain Cook\u2019s crew estimated a Tongan canoe could sail \u201cthree miles to our two.\u201d </span></p><p><span>After a visit to the Society Islands in 1774, Spanish Captain Andia y Varela described the canoes he saw: \u201cIt would give the most skillful [European] builder a shock to see craft having no more breadth of beam than three [arm] spans carrying a spread of sail so large as to befit one of ours with a beam of eight or ten spans, and which, though without means of lowering or furling the sail, make sport of the winds and waves during a gale. These canoes are as fine forward as the edge of a knife, so that they travel faster than the swiftest of our vessels; and they are marvellous, not only in this respect, but for their smartness in shifting from one tack to the other.\u201d </span></p><p><span>The voyaging was by no means easy. There was always a danger of swamping or capsizing in heavy seas, of having sails ripped apart or Masts and booms broken by fierce winds, of smashing the hulls against unseen rocks or reefs; and while there were grass or leaf shelters on the decks of voyaging canoes, the voyagers were often exposed to the wind, rain, and sun, with only capes of leaves or bark-cloth wrappings for protection. A stormy night at sea, even in the tropics, can be brutally chilling. If supplies ran short during a long voyage, and no fish or rainwater replenished them, then starvation became a possibility. </span></p><p><span>A long voyage was not just a physical, but a mental challenge as well, particularly for a navigator without compass or chart. To navigate miles of open ocean required an extensive and intimate knowledge of the ocean and sky. Captain Cook noted that Polynesian navigators used the rising and setting points of celestial bodies for directions. </span></p><p><span>To keep track of their position at sea during long sea voyages, the navigators used a system of dead reckoning\u2014memorizing the distance and direction traveled until the destination was reached. Finding islands before they could actually be seen was also part of the art of navigation. Voyagers followed the flight of land-dwelling, birds that fished at sea as these birds flew from the direction of islands in the morning or returned in the evenings. The navigators also watched for changes in swell patterns, clouds piled up over land, reflections on clouds from lagoons, and drifting land vegetation.</span></p>", "question": "11.

The Untold Story of Rock-and-Roll Trail-blazer Sister Rosetta Tharpe</i> by Gayle F. Wald (\u00a92007 by Gayle F. Wald).</p><p>Sister Rosetta Tharpe, as she was professionally billed, was not supposed to be a highlight of the fall 1938 Cotton Club revue, a fast-paced variety show headlining Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers, young dancers who thrilled audiences with their acrobatic elegance. Originally, this emerging gospel singer was just a gamble, signed by Herman Stark for two weeks. Like other new attractions, Rosetta constituted one part of a huge supporting cast, performers who largely filled time between the big numbers. Early print advertisements did not mention her name. </p><p>Yet from the outset, audiences were thrilled by Rosetta\u2019s unusual sound and style. Newspaper reporters, white and black, struggled for the right words to describe her. Most used some variation of \u201cswing\u201d to convey the rhythmic quality of her music, calling her a \u201cswinger of spirituals,\u201d a \u201cspiritual swinging favorite,\u201d a \u201chymn swinging evangelist,\u201d and a \u201chymnswinger.\u201d The<span> <i>Chicago Defender</i> called her \u201ca swingcopated manipulator of loud blue tones\u201d and noted that \u201cshe handles the guitar rather creditably in accompaniment.\u201d </span></p><p>Still others compared Rosetta to Bessie Smith, the blues singer whose career was cut short by a 1937 car accident. Like Smith, Rosetta presented a compelling picture of black female self-assurance and vigor when she performed. Indeed, her \u201cgospel blues\u201d and Smith\u2019s secular blues were not all that distinct. Musically, both sprang from sources in slave culture, and both confronted the harshness of the world with determination to \u201cmake a way outta no way.\u201d For gospel singers, this \u201cway\u201d was through God; for blues singers, it was through self-reliance. </p><p>From October to December 1938, events of profound and lasting significance to Rosetta\u2019s career occurred almost weekly. Irving Mills approached Rosetta in mid-October and soon had her signed to an \u201cexclusive publishing contract\u201d with Mills Music. A company with an international distribution network, Mills Music quickly published<span> <i>Eighteen Original Negro Spirituals</i>, an impressive booklet containing songs \u201cwith an original and appealing religious quality set down exactly as sung by Sister Tharpe since infancy in Negro churches all over the country.\u201d Encompassing such titles as \u201cI Look Down the Road and I Wonder,\u201d \u201cMy Lord and I,\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s All,\u201d <i>Eighteen Original Negro Spirituals</i> would serve as a crucial source of Rosetta\u2019s repertoire for the next thirty-five years. </span></p><p>Music publishing was important\u2014as early gospel entrepreneurs well understood\u2014but it didn\u2019t have the glamour of sound recordings. Some of that glamour became Rosetta\u2019s when she signed a contract the same month with Decca Records. </p><p>Decca had recorded songs by gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in May 1937, but they did so poorly that the label dropped her and didn\u2019t venture back into the gospel field until it took a chance on Rosetta seventeen months later. With her bell-like voice, winning smile, and Cotton Club notoriety, Rosetta had the combination of the musical goods and showbiz flair that Mahalia had lacked. Her first records, recorded in a single session on October 31, 1938, with Rosetta accompanying herself on guitar, were instant successes. How successful they were in hard numbers is difficult to say, but successful enough to Rosetta back for a second session in January 1939 and to keep her in Decca\u2019s employ, without interruption. until the mid-1950s. </p><p>Rosetta\u2019s first session reveals a young woman Capable of finding and communicating the emotional core of a song through exquisite phrasing, inventive vocal technique, and guitar playing of originality, confidence, and grace. Her years of using her gift in live performance had taught her how to make a listener feel a song, not just hear it, by making use of vibrato, trills, enunciation, dynamic variety (variations in loudness), and melisma, a gospel hallmark in which the vocalist sings several notes within the space of a single syllable. Like a blues or jazz singer, Rosetta tended to sing around the beat rather than on top of it. allowing for rhythmic complexity and improvisation. Like a blues singer, too, she was capable of covering material of enormous topical and emotional variety. Her first four cuts for Decca range widely in from the sassy satire of \u201cThat\u2019s All\u201d to the wistful contentment of \u201cMy Man and I\u201d to the extroverted exuberance of \u201cRock Me\u201d and the longing of \u201cThe Lonesome Road.\u201d All bore the mark of a singer-player of extraordinary control and personality.</p>", "question": "30.

The word <i>syntax</i> refers to the grammatical structure of a sentence</span>. </h5><p>The linguistic phenomenon in Shakespeare which is known as \u2018functional shift\u2019 refers to the way that Shakespeare will often use one part of speech\u2014a noun or an adjective, say\u2014to serve as another, often a verb, shifting its grammatical nature with minimal alteration to its shape. Thus in <i>Lear</i> for example, Edgar comparing himself to the king: \u2018He chided as fathered\u2019 (nouns \u2018child\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 shifted to verbs); in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, '<i>Kingdomed</i> Achilles in commotion rages\u2019 (noun \u2018kingdom\u2019 converted to adjective). </p><p>Research suggests that there is one, specific part of the brain that processes nouns and another part that processes verbs: but what happens when for a micro-second there is a serious hesitation between whether, in context, this is noun or verb? </p><p>With the help of my colleague in English language, Victorina, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, as well as scientists, I designed a set of stimuli\u201440 examples of Shakespeare\u2019s functional shift. At this very early and rather primitive stage, we could not give our student-subjects undiluted lines of Shakespeare because too much in the brain would light up in too many places: that is one of the definitions of what Shakespeare-language does. So, the stimuli we created were simply to do with the noun-to-verb or verb-to-noun shift-words themselves, with more ordinary language around them. </p><p>Around each of those sentences of functional shift we also provided three counterexamples which were shown on screen to the experiment\u2019s subjects in random order: all they had to do was press a button saying whether the sentence roughly made sense or not. Thus, below, A (\u2018accompany\u2019) is a sentence which is conventionally grammatical, makes simple sense, and acts as a control; B (\u2018charcoal\u2019) is grammatically odd, like a functional shift, but it makes no semantic sense in context; C (\u2018incubate\u2019) is grammatically correct but still semantically does not make sense; D (\u2018companion\u2019) is a Shakespearian functional shift from noun to verb, and is grammatically odd but does make sense: </p><p>A) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said you would<i> accompany</i> me. </p><p> B) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said you would<span> <i>charcoal</i> me. </span></p><p> C) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said you would<span> <i>incubate</i> me. </span></p><p> D) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said you would<span> <i>companion</i> me. </span></p><p>So far we have just carried out the EEG stage of experimentation. EEG works as follows in its graph like measurements. When the brain senses a semantic violation, it automatically registers what is called an N400 effect, a negative wave modulation 400 milliseconds after the onset of the critical word that disrupts the meaning of a sentence. The N400 amplitude is small when little semantic integration effort is needed (e.g., to integrate the word \u2018eat\u2019 in the sentence \u2018The pizza was too hot to eat\u2019), and large when the critical word is unexpected and therefore difficult to integrate (e.g., The pizza was too hot to<span> <i>sing</i>\u2019). </span></p><p>But when the brain senses a syntactic violation, there is a P600 effect, a parietal modulation peaking approximately 600 milliseconds after the onset of the word that upsets syntactic integrity. Thus, when a word violates the grammatical structure of a sentence (e.g., \u2018The pizza was too hot to<span> <i>mouth</i>\u2019), a positive wave is systematically observed. </span></p><p>Preliminary results suggest this: </p><p>(A) With the simple control sentence (\u2018you said you would<span> <i>accompany</i> me\u2019), NO N400 or P600 effect because it is correct both semantically and syntactically. </span></p><p>(B) With \u2018you said you would<span> <i>charcoal</i> me\u2019, BOTH N400 and P600 high because it violates both grammar and meaning. </span></p><p>(C) With \u2018you said you would<span> <i>incubate</i> me\u2019, NO P600 (it makes grammatical sense) but HIGH N400 (it makes no semantic sense). </span></p><p>(D) With the Shakespearian \u2018you said you would<span> <i>companion</i> me\u2019, HIGH P600 (because it feels like a grammatical anomaly) but NO N400 (the brain will tolerate it, almost straightaway, as making sense despite the grammatical difficulty).
