Any material with a low value-to-weight ratio, such as foodstuffs, that couldn\u2019t be transported to distant markets by water couldn\u2019t be sold in those markets at a price anyone would pay. This meant that national economies were fragmented into an infinity of local ones. </p><p><b class=\"now\">Until the Industrial Revolution, there was only one way to reduce these transportation costs: build artificial rivers. By the end of the eighteenth century England was well laced with canals, greatly facilitating industrialization as factories could sell their goods profitably throughout the entire country. </b></p><p><b class=\"now\">But the new United States was 10 times the size of England and far less developed. And a considerable mountain range divided the more developed eastern seaboard from the fertile, resource-rich, and rapidly growing West. Settlers west of the Appalachians had no choice but to send their crops down the Mississippi to market.</b> </p><p>Along the whole great chain of mountains that stretched from Maine to Alabama, there was only a single gap\u4e00where the Mohawk River tumbles into the Hudson near Albany\u2014at which a canal was even theoretically possible. </p><p>The idea of building a canal to connect the Hudson with the Great Lakes there had been around for many years but always dismissed as hopelessly impracticable. <span>Even Thomas Jefferson thought the idea \u201clittle short of madness.\u201d DeWitt Clinton, however, did not. Born into a prominent New York family (his uncle had been governor of New York and then Vice President under James Madison), Clinton would be the mayor of New York City and governor of the state for most of the first quarter of the nineteenth century. A shrewd politician, he built public support for the canal and pushed it through a reluctant state legislature. </span></p><p><span>One can understand the reluctance, for the project was huge by the standards of the day. At 363 miles the Erie would be by far the longest canal in the world. It would require moving, largely by hand, 11.4 million cubic yards of earth and rock\u2014well over three times the volume of the Great Pyramid of Egypt\u2014and building locks in what was still a semiwilderness. The budget, seven million dollars, was about equal to one percent of the gross domestic product of the entire country. Nonetheless, when the federal government refused to help, New York decided to go it alone. It was a gigantic roll of the economic dice, but one that paid off beyond even Clinton\u2019s dreams. The Erie Canal put the Empire in the Empire State. </span></p><p><span>The canal was a success even before it fully opened, as traffic burgeoned on the completed parts, helping fund continuing construction. When it was finished in 1825, ahead of schedule and under budget, traffic was tremendous from the start. It is not hard to understand why. Before, it had taken three weeks and cost $120 to ship a ton of flour from Buffalo to New York City. With the canal, it took eight days and cost $6.</span></p><p><span>Produce that had gone down the Mississippi to New Orleans now began to flow eastward. In a few years the Boston poet and physician Oliver Wendell Holmes (father of the Supreme Court justice) described New York as \u201cthat tongue that is licking up the cream of commerce and finance of a continent.\u201d In 1800 about 9 percent of American exports passed through the port of New York.

It rhymes with \u201cfuss\u201d and means dust, literally \u201cloose.\u201d Loess is fine yellowish mineral stuff, rock pulverized by glaciers over the 150 millennia of the last ice age and carried south by rivers. When the rivers dried, they left tons of this siltlike powder to be picked up by winds and scattered across the heartland. </span></p><p>Under the rich topsoil of its green croplands, most of Iowa is covered in a 50-foot-deep blanket of loess. Only here, though, where the winds from the west met the Missouri\u2019s eastern shore, was the loess dumped in great heaps. The only other landform like it is along the banks of China\u2019s Yellow River, named for its loess-clouded waters. </p><p><i>Fragile Giants</i><span> is what scientific historian Cornelia Mutel titled her 1989 book, the best natural history yet of the hills. Fragile indeed. Where the loess is exposed, you can break it off in chunks and crumble it to a powder that disappears almost before it hits the ground. </span></p><p>From the ground, the topography calls to mind the intricate, pleated patterns of sand dunes. Long, meandering ridges are like spines with rows of smaller ridges projecting out like ribs, and even smaller spur ridges projecting from these in turn. Natural terraces follow the hills\u2019 contours because of the mineral soil\u2019s peculiar inclination to compact into straight vertical walls. These \u201ccatsteps\u201d\u2014unmistakable signatures of loess terrain\u2014create a complex network of ridges, a hiker\u2019s dream of hilltop mazes with nonstop prairie vistas. </p><p>Most of Iowa\u2019s prairie long ago fell victim to the plow or the pavement. But because the Loess Hills are often too steep for row crops, pockets of high-quality virgin prairie remain. Big bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, prairie clovers, lead plant, and dozens of other grasses, sedges, and flowering plants mottle the hills. </p><p>When Lewis and Clark passed within a few miles of this spot 200 years ago, it was largely a treeless landscape. Back then, fire would scorch any given patch of prairie every four to seven years. In autumn, the dry plants could fuel towering flames and intense heat. These conflagrations could advance faster than a person on horseback could flee, but they were as vital to the survival of a prairie as water itself. Prairie plants evolved root systems up to 15 feet deep to survive the flames. </p><p>To bring fire back, Pape and his crew are part of a network of prescribed-burn fire-setters called the Stewardship Committee. Of the hills\u2019 650,000 acres, only about 18,000\u2014a patchwork of state, county, and privately owned parklands\u2014are under any sort of conservation management. The committee does its best to burn those areas as regularly as nature once did. It\u2019s a sort of latter-day ecological posse, a band of professionals trained in fire management that convenes whenever and wherever conditions are right to incinerate bad guys like overgrown sumac, dogwood, eastern red cedar, and the invasive Siberian elm. </p><p>It takes less than an hour for the committee to transform the patch of lush prairie into a smoking black blanket. All around, the scorched skeletons of hundreds of young sumac trees stand, still vertical but ready to disintegrate into ashes. In a few weeks, this area will be green again.</p>", "question": "40.
