The only thing I had anticipated at the start of the semester. That was seeing Eugene. In  August, Eugene and  his  family   had  moved into the only house on the block that had a yard and trees. I could see his place from my bedroom window in  El Building. In fact, if I sat on the fire escape I was literally suspended above Eugene's backyard. It was my favorite spot to read my library books in the summer. Until that August the house had been occupied by an old couple. Over the years I had become part of their family, without their knowing it, of course. I had a view   of their kitchen and their backyard, and though I could   not hear what they said, I knew when they were arguing, when one of them was sick, and many other things. I knew all this by watching them at mealtimes. I could see their kitchen table, the sink, and the stove. During good times, he sat at the table and read his newspapers while  she fixed the meals. If they argued, he would leave and the old woman would sit and stare at nothing for a long time. When one of them was sick, the other would come and get things from the kitchen and carry them out on a tray. The old man had died in June. The house had stood empty for  weeks. I  had  had  to  resist the  temptation  to climb down into the yard and water the flowers the old  lady had taken such good care of.</p><p>By the time Eugene's family moved in, the yard was a tangled mass of weeds. The father had spent several days mowing, and when he finished, from where I sat, I didn't see the red, yellow, and purple clusters that meant flowers to me. I didn't see this family sit down at the kitchen table together. It was just the mother, a red-headed tall woman who wore a white uniform; the father was gone before I got up in the morning and was never there at dinner time. I only saw him on weekends when they sometimes sat on lawn-chairs under the oak tree, each hidden behind a section of the newspaper; and there was Eugene. He was tall and blond, and he wore glasses. I liked him right away because he sat at the kitchen table and read books for hours. That summer, before we had even spoken one word to each other, I kept him company on my fire escape.</p><p><span>Once school started I looked for him in all my classes, but P. S. 13 was a huge place and it took me </span><span>days and many discreet questions to discover Eugene. After much maneuvering I managed \"to  run  into him\" in the hallway where his  locker was\u2014on the  other side of the building from mine\u2014and in study hall at the library where he first seemed to notice me, but did not </span><span>speak; and finally, on the way home after school one  day when I decided to approach him  directly, though my stomach was doing somersaults.</span></p><p><span>I was ready for rejection, snobbery, the worst. But when  I   came  up  to  him  and  blurted  out: \"You're </span><span>Eugene. Right?\" he  smiled, pushed his glasses up  on  his nose, and nodded. I saw then that he was blushing deeply. Eugene liked me, but he was shy. I did most of the talking that day. He nodded and smiled a lot. In the weeks that followed, we walked home together.

Her journey to greatness, her voyage out beyond the confines of good wife and devoted mother, involved determination and amazing courage. It also involved one of history's most <span>unique partnerships. Franklin Delano Roosevelt [FDR] admired his wife, appreciated her strengths, and depended on her integrity.</span></p><p><span>However, ER and FDR had different priorities, </span><span>occasionally competing goals, and often disagreed. In the White House they ran two distinct and separate courts.</span></p><p><span>By 1933 [her first year as First Lady], ER was an accomplished woman who had achieved several of her </span><span>life's goals. With her partners, ER was a businesswoman who co-owned the Val-Kill crafts factory, a political leader who edited and copublished the <i>Women's Democratic News</i>, and an educator who co-owned and taught at a New York school for girls.</span></p><p><span>As First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt did things that     had never been done before. She upset race traditions, championed a New Deal for women, and on certain issues actually ran a parallel administration. On housing and the creation of model communities, for </span><span>example, ER made decisions and engineered policy.</span></p><p><span>At the center of a network of influential women who ran the Women's Committee of the Democratic Party led by Molly Dewson, ER worked closely with  the women who had dominated the nation's social </span><span>reform struggles for decades. With FDR's election, the goals of the great progressive pioneers, Jane Addams, Florence Kelley, and Lillian Wald, were at last at the forefront of the country's agenda. ER's mentors since 1903, they had battled on the margins of national poli</span><span>tics since the 1880s for public health, universal education, community centers, sanitation programs, and government responsibility for the welfare of the nation's poor and neglected people.</span></p><p><span>Now their views were brought directly into the </span><span>White House. ER lobbied for them personally with her new administrative allies, in countless auditoriums, as a radio broadcaster, and in monthly, weekly, and, by 1936, daily columns. Called \"Eleanor Everywhere,\" she was interested in everyone.</span></p><p><span>Every life was  sacred and  worthy, to  be  improved by education, employment, health care, and affordable housing. Her goal was simple, a life of dignity and decency for all. She was uninterested in complex theories, and demanded action for betterment. She feared </span><span>violent revolution, but was not afraid of socialism\u2014and she courted radicals.</span></p><p>As fascism and communism triumphed in Europe and Asia, ER and FDR were certain that there was a middle way, what ER called an American \"revolution without bloodshed.\" Her abiding conviction, however, was that nothing good would happen to promote the people's interest unless the people themselves organized to demand government responses. A people's movement required active citizen participation, and ER's self-appointed task was to agitate and inspire community action, encourage united democratic movements for change.</p><p><span>Between 1933 and 1938, while the Depression raged and the New Deal unfolded, ER worked with the </span><span>popular front. She called for alliances of activists to fight poverty and racism at home, and to oppose isolationism internationally.</span></p><p><span>Active with the women's peace movement, ER spoke regularly at meetings of the Women's Inter</span><span>national League for Peace and Freedom, and the Conference on the Cause and Cure of War. She departed, however, from pacifist and isolationist positions and encouraged military preparedness, collective security, and ever-widening alliances.</span></p><p><span>Between 1933 and 1938 ER  published  countless articles and six books. She wrote in part for herself, to clear her mind and focus her thoughts. But she also wrote to disagree with her husband. From that time to this, no other First Lady has actually rushed for her pen </span><span>to jab her husband's public decisions. But ER did so routinely, including in her 1938 essay <i>This Troubled World</i>, which was a point-by-point rejection of FDR's major international decisions.</span></p><p><span>To contemplate ER's life of example and responsi</span><span>bility is to forestall gloom. She  understood, above all, that politics is not an isolated individualist adventure. She sought alliances, created community, worked with movements for justice and peace. Against great odds, and  under terrific pressure, she  refused   to  withdraw </span><span>from controversy. She brought her network of agitators and activists into the White House, and never considered a political setback a permanent defeat. She enjoyed the game, and weathered the abuse.</span></p>", "question": "11.

Its egoism blinds it and deafens it; its imagination spins out ignorant tales,  fascinated. It fancies that the western wind blows on the Self, and leaves fall at the feet of the Self for a reason, and people are watching. A mind risks real ignorance <span>for the sometimes paltry prize of an imagination enriched. The trick of reason is to get the imagination to seize the actual world\u2014if only from time to time.</span></p><p><span>When I  was  five, I  would not  go  to  bed willingly </span><span>because something came into my room. My sister Amy, two years old, was asleep in  the other bed. What did  she know? She was innocent of evil. There was no messiness in her, no roughness for things to cling to, only a charming and charmed innocence that seemed </span><span>then to protect her, an innocence I needed but couldn't muster. Since Amy was asleep, furthermore, and since when I needed someone most I was afraid to stir enough to wake her, she was useless.</span></p><p><span>I  lay  alone and  was  almost asleep when the   thing </span><span>entered the room by flattening itself against the open door and sliding in. It was a transparent, luminous oblong. I could see the door whiten at its touch; I could see the blue wall turn pale where it  raced over it,  and see the maple headboard of Amy's bed glow. It was a</span><span> swift spirit; it was an awareness. It made noise. It  had  two joined parts, a head and a tail. It found the door, wall, and headboard; and it swiped them, charging them with its luminous glance. After its fleet, searching passage, things looked the same, but weren't.</span></p><p><span>I dared not blink or breathe. If it found another awareness, it would destroy it.</span></p><p><span>Every night before it got to me it gave up. It  hit  my wall's corner and couldn't get past. It shrank completely into itself and vanished. I heard the rising roar it </span><span>made when it died or left. I still couldn't breathe. I knew that it could return again alive that same night.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes it came back, sometimes it didn't. Most often, restless, it came back. The light stripe slipped in the door, ran searching over Amy's wall, </span><span>stopped, stretched lunatic at the first corner, raced wailing toward my wall, and vanished into the second corner with a cry. So I wouldn't go to bed.</span></p><p><span>It was a passing car whose windshield reflected the corner streetlight outside. I figured it out one night.</span></p><p><span>Figuring it  out  was  as  memorable as  the  oblong itself. Figuring it out was a long and forced ascent to  the very rim of being, to the membrane of skin that both separates and connects the inner life and the outer world. I climbed deliberately from the depths like a </span><span>diver who releases the monster in his arms and hauls </span><span>himself hand over hand up an anchor chain till he meets the ocean's sparkling membrane and  bursts through it; he sights the sunlit, becalmed hull of his boat, which  had bulked so ominously from below.</span></p><p><span>I recognized the noise it made when it left. That is,  the noise it made called to mind, at last, my daytime sensations when a car passed\u2014the sight and noise together. A car came roaring down hushed Edgerton Avenue in front of our house, stopped, and passed on </span><span>shrieking as its engine shifted up the gears. What, precisely, came into the bedroom? A reflection from the car's oblong windshield. Why did it travel in two parts? The window sash split the light and cast a shadow.</span></p><p><span>Night after night I labored up the same long chain </span><span>of reasoning, as night after night the thing burst into the room where I lay awake.</span></p><p><span>There was a world outside my window and contiguous to it. Why did I have to keep learning this same thing over and over? For I had learned it a summer ago, </span><span>when men with jackhammers broke up Edgerton Avenue. I had watched them from the yard. When I lay to nap, I listened. One restless afternoon I  connected  the new noise in my bedroom with the jackhammer men   I had been seeing outside.
