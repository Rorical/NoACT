A soft-spoken man of forty, Kallenberger moved to Tulsa at the age of one and has seldom left since. Form the foothills, it's a short drive down Apache Street to his home and studio on Reservoir Hill. There, he reworks the burnt hills and blasted sky in the cool medium of glass.</p><p><span>Kallenberger's Osage sculptures would look like at home on the shelves of a Rocky Mountain minerals shop, surrounded by geodes. Most are long wedges of cast optical crystal, glacial melon slices weighing as much as fifty pounds. On the tops and sides, they are all precision\u2014sliced, notched, and polished. Yet this refinement has a raw edge. The rugged bottoms are peaks and valleys, stained with the colors and vistas of the nearby bills. As Kallenberger readies them for a February show at Boca Raton\u2019s Habatat Galleries, Osage works are strewn about the studio. They seem to have been sliced from the foothills with sky intact, as if God were gathering landscape samples for the next world.</span></p><p>These are works of time-consuming craftsman-ship: when Kallenberger says, \"I rarely leave the house,\" one believes him. His intensity and background in engineering may be prerequisites for sculptors working with glass. The days are spent lugging crystal ingots, tinkering with the furnace, sketching, fabricating molds, monitoring the slow processes of heating, cooling, grinding, and polishing. His chosen wedge shape is particularly vulnerable to the cooling fails or the equipment settings are inaccurate, the result is fracture. \"This is not a predictable industry,\" he says. \"You base this success on the last failure.\" he completed just twelve Osage pieces last year.</p><p><span>The sculptor's reputation has taken off in the past six or seven years. He now has regular one-man shows at the two Habatat Galleries, located at Farmington Hills near Detroit and in Boca Raton. Through Habatat, he has attended the influential New Art Forms show at Chicago's Navy Pier each autumn. And in 1984, on the strength of his Interlock and Cuneiform series, he received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant. He is represented in Tulsa by M. A. Doran Gallery, and his works are in the Detroit Institute of Arts, Atlanta's High Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</span></p><p><span>In April of [1990], Kallenberger was featured in the Detroit Habatat's Eighteenth Annual International Invitational exhibition. Ferdinand Hampson, who cofounded the gallery with Tom and Linda Boone, says, \"These are theoretically the greatest artists in glass today, and Kreg dominated the show in sales and critical opinion.\"</span></p><p>Kallenberger's current themes emerged with the Titanic series in the mid-eighties. The wedges of his earlier Cuneiform series reappeared, elongated and deeper. Key details\u2014a scoop or notch, a pair of black circles\u2014appeared on the thin top edge, in contrast with the deep and massive whole. Along came the rough edges, controlled fractures, eventually stained by hand.</p><p>The optical effects of the Osage sculptures are dazzling. As one walks around each piece, its transparent volume suddenly fills up with the refracted landscape of the bottom edge\u2014a sculpture filled with an image. \"The glass just does that,\" he says. The power of basis shapes is his focus, as are contrasts of texture and color.</p><p>Oddly, the charisma of glass exerts a special fascination for men. \"It seems to be made through mysterious processes,\" Kallenberger says. Among his audience are \"CEOs [Chief Executive Officers of corporations] who've never bought sculpture or any art before.\" Presented with identical shapes in bronze and glass, this hypothetical male CEO will prefer the latter. Why? \"Because he <i>thinks</i> he knows how the bronze shape is made. It's made sort of like his car is made. It's metal\u2014you can hammer on it, weld it. He looks at the same form in glass and has no idea how it was made. Men look at a piece and say, 'How did you <i>do</i> that?'\"<br/></p>", "question": "21.
