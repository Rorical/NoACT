His father had taken him to Tokyo by train and together they walked to the theater in a steady downpour. It was October 22 and so it was a cold autumn rain and the streets were waxed in a paper-thin layer of wet red leaves. When they arrived at the Tokyo Metropolitan Festival Hall, their undershirts were wet beneath coats and sweaters. The tickets waiting inside  Katsumi Hosokawa's father's billfold were wet and discolored. They did not have especially good seats, but their view was unobstructed. In 1954, money was precious; train tickets and operas were unimaginable things. They climbed the long set of stairs to their row, careful not to look down into the dizzying void beneath them. They bowed and begged to be excused by every person who stood to let them pass into their seats, and then they unfolded their seats and slipped inside. They were early. They waited, father and son, without speaking, until finally the darkness fell and the first breath of music stirred from someplace far below them. Tiny people, insects, really, slipped out from behind the curtains, opened their mouths, and with their voices gilded the walls with their yearning, their grief, their boundless love. </p><p>It was during that performance of <i>Rigoletto</i> that opera imprinted itself on Katsumi Hosokawa. Many years later, when everything was business, when he worked harder than anyone in a country whose values are structured on hard work, he believed that life, true life, was something that was stored in music. True life was kept safe in the lines of Tchaikovsky's <i>Eugene Onegin</i> while you went out into the world and met the obligations required of you. Certainly he knew (though  did not completely understand) that opera wasn't for everyone, but for everyone he hoped there was something. He knew that without opera, part of himself would have vanished altogether. It was early in the second act, when Rigoletto and Gilda sang together, their voices twining, leaping, that he reached out for his father's hand. He had no idea what they were saying, nor did he know that they played the parts of father and daughter, he only knew that he needed to hold to something. The pull they had on him was so strong he could feel himself falling forward out of the high and distant seats. </p><p>Such love breeds loyalty, and Mr. Hosokawa was a loyal man. He never forgot the importance of Verdi in his life. He became attached to certain singers, as everyone does. He believed in the genius of Maria Callas above all others. There was never a great deal of time in his days. Custom was that after having dinner with clients and completing paperwork, he would spend thirty minutes listening to music before falling asleep. It was impossibly rare, maybe five Sundays a year, that he found three consecutive hours to listen to one opera start to finish. Once, in his late forties, he ate a spoiled oyster and suffered a vicious bout of food poisoning that kept him home for three days. He remembered this time as happily as any vacation because he played Handel's <i>Alcina</i> continually, even while he slept. </p><p>It was his eldest daughter, Kiyomi, who bought him his first recording of Roxane Coss for his birthday. Her father was a nearly impossible man to buy gifts for, and so when she saw the disc and a name she did not recognize, she thought she would take a chance. But it wasn't the unknown name that drew her, it was the woman's face. Kiyomi found the pictures of sopranos irritating. They were always peering over the tops of fans or gazing through veils of soft netting. But Roxane Coss looked at her directly, even her chin was straight, her eyes were wide open. Kiyomi gave her money to the girl at the counter. </p><p>When Mr. Hosokawa put the CD in the player and sat down in his chair to listen, he did not go back to work that night. It was as if he was a boy in those high seats in Tokyo again, his father's hand large and warm around his own. It was soaring, that voice, warm and complicated, utterly fearless. How could it be at once controlled and so reckless? He called Kiyomi's name and she came and stood in the doorway of his study. She started to say something\u2014yes? or, what? or, sir?\u2014 but before she could make out the words she heard that voice, the straight-ahead woman from the picture.

So it is, too, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where House is the guiding force behind a landscape of cornfields, meadows, forest and wetlands\u2014complete with 3,500 specially introduced ladybugs\u2014outside the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. </p><p>In her career as an ethnobotanist, House, who grew up on a Navajo reservation in Arizona, has served as a translator of sorts between \"the people\" (or the Dineh) and the outside world. A traditional \"old school\" Indian, as she sometimes jokingly refers to herself, as well as an environmental scientist, she has worked for or consulted with the Nature Conservancy, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the Navajo Nation and others, helping to protect rare and endangered plants that have cultural, as well as ecological, significance. \"Recognizing the diversity of plants is no different than recognizing the diversity of people,\" she said. </p><p>Along the way, she often bridges the gap between the native world view\u2014in which human beings and nature are interrelated, and all plants, animals and mountains and other landforms are sacred\u2014and the more scientific one, pollinating a deeper understanding between them. Her home ground, or habitat\u2014a word she prefers to landscape\u2014stretches far into the horizon, to the cottonwoods along the river presided over by the steep, rocky mesa. \"A landscape is not dynamic,\" she said. \"A habitat is a place where beings come to life.\" </p><p>These fields were farmland until House, much to the consternation of some of her neighbors, dispensed with the alfalfa and roses, \"allowing the memory of the land to return.\" The globe mallow, prized by the Navajo for its medicinal applications, came back. So did the sunflowers, used for millennia by the Navajo to treat prenatal infections. The Navajo have also fashioned the hollow stalks of sunflowers into bird snares and flutes and boiled the seed hulls for a dark-red dye. The seeds themselves are used for soup. </p><p>To the Mall's polite formality\u2014its \"tulips all in a line,\" in House's words\u2014has come a contrasting presence: a wetland visible from the Capitol sprouting cattails, wild rice and about 1,440 waterlilies. Visitors meander past a meadow of buttercups, panic grass and other Potomac Valley plants and a somewhat surreal field of corn, tobacco, squash and other crops. Massive boulders, shipped from as far away as the Northwest Territories, echo the curvaceous form of the museum building, its rough-hewn limestone surface meant to recall a cliff face sculptured by the wind. </p><p>To acquaint herself with the Middle Atlantic region, House consulted fellow botanists, but also set out on the Potomac River in a canoe.

Zuckerwar. In his office in Hampton, Va., he rattles off items as dissimilar as rhinoceroses, supersonic aircraft, and hurricanes. \"Now, what do they have in common?\" The answer, Zuckerwar explains, is that each one generates silent infrasound\u2014long sound waves at a frequency below 20 hertz. People can't hear anything below that frequency, probably for good reason. Otherwise, they'd be bombarded by the constant din of wind, the intermittent groaning of Earth, and the occasional distant explosion. But scientists are eavesdropping on volcanoes, avalanches, earthquakes, and meteorites to discern these phenomena's infrasound signatures and see what new information infrasound might reveal. </p><p>Just as seismic waves travel through Earth, infrasonic waves travel through the air. And the lower the frequency of the waves, the farther they can travel without losing strength. Scientists first detected infrasound in 1883, when the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia sent inaudible sound waves careening around the world, affecting barometric readings. </p><p>Infrasonic research gained significant attention and funding in the 1950s, when the United States and the Soviet Union used infrasound to detect each other's atmospheric nuclear testing. Interest declined when aboveground bomb testing was banned in 1963 as part of the Limited Test Ban Treaty. </p><p>But lately, scientists have turned back to infrasound. </p><p>Infrasound interpretation is a young science. Acousticians and geophysicists are still learning what phenomena generate infrasound signatures and how to match signatures with phenomena. </p><p>For example, John V. Olson of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks recalls one morning last April when a colleague rushed into his office and asked whether he had heard an explosion the night before. The two scientists found a large pulse on the infrasound record from the nuclear-test monitoring station that the university operates and traced it to a nearby firing range. The next day, the local paper reported that a citizen had found a bundle of dynamite, which police exploded at the range. </p><p>\"So, we take [the signal] out of the 'little green men' file and say, 'This is what dynamite looks like from 5 miles away,'\" says Olson. \"Slowly, daily, we sift and sort through these signals.\" </p><p>Ocean storms and waves are two of the big generators of infrasound, says Milton A. Garc\u00e9s of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The routine up-and-down movements of the waves act as a giant loudspeaker, pushing the air at infrasonic frequencies. </p><p>Low-frequency sounds are also generated by one of the most colorful displays in the sky, the northern lights, which are caused by charged particles in the air. This electricity heats atmospheric gases, and the warmed gas molecules spread out and increase air pressure. </p><p>\"It pushes the neutral air forward, almost like the bow wave off a ship,\" says Olson. This air movement creates an infrasonic signal. The readings are visible during the beginnings of these magnetic storms, as the bright, greenish lights sweep across the sky like a fluttering curtain. </p><p>While specialized microphones can pick up infrasonic signals generated high in the atmosphere, they detect more earthly rumbles, as well. For instance, Jeffrey B. Johnson of the University of Hawaii at Manoa has placed microphones within a kilometer of a vent of the active Erebus volcano in Antarctica. The sensors have recorded low-frequency signals so powerful that, were they audible, they'd have a volume in excess of 130 decibels\u2014\"somewhere between a jet airplane and the threshold of pain,\" says Johnson. Erebus does produce some audible sound, but it's not very loud, he says.</p><p>The infrasound radiating from the volcano\u2018s lava lake is generated by the rupture of 10-meter-wide, gasfilled bubbles, which pushes huge infrasound waves into the atmosphere.
