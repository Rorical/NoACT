It was a steal, </span><span>$600 a month for an L-shaped one-bedroom in </span><span>a prewar building at 615 West 164th Street. All </span><span>the apartments faced the courtyard, and as if </span><span>watching a stage from a production booth, I </span><span>saw my relatives and longtime neighbors </span><span>across the way from my second-floor window.</span></p><p><span>Because I wanted color and to hide the defects </span><span>on the walls, I painted the bedroom an oceanic </span><span>blue, the living room the color of a mango, the </span><span>bathroom a leaf green.</span></p><p>The apartment bore signs of its past and wasn't <span>perfect. The dumbwaiter had been turned into a </span><span>pantry. The kitchen cabinets didn't close all the </span><span>way, and the wooden floors were hidden by </span><span>beige industrial tiles. Then there were the </span><span>plumbing ghosts. My toilet flushed randomly, </span><span>all by itself, and the sink in the kitchen filled </span><span>up with bubbles when the lady upstairs did her </span><span>wash.</span></p><p>I woke up in the morning with the sunlight, and <span>from my kitchen window I often greeted my </span><span>grandmother, who lived across the courtyard, </span><span>her asking me, \"Are you still studying up </span><span>there?\"</span></p><p><span>That had been my explanation when she asked </span><span>me why didn't I have a job with good benefits. </span><span>\"Estudiando\" is the one word that magically </span><span>answered all the questions from my relatives </span><span>when I locked myself up and didn\u2019t pick up the </span><span>phone, even when they saw that my light was </span><span>on. \"We are estudiando,\" I said, when my relatives </span><span>stood at my front door holding plastic </span><span>containers filled with dinner, and saw a group </span><span>of women crowded in the living room plotting </span><span>an event, discussing politics, sharing their </span><span>writing.</span></p><p>Although my apartment was a snug 500 square feet, filled with books, museum posters and my very bad but honest figurative paintings, the rooms seemed to swell in size when other writers needed a place to stay. And so my apartment was often full of people coming and going, crammed with additional desks and beds for short-term stays. There was always a fresh batch of iced tea in the fridge, an answering machine to answer my calls, photographs on my desk of all the people I love.</p><p>The wooden and ceramic dolls I collected from different parts of the world watched over my laptop. My desk faced the courtyard, a neglected garden overgrown with weeds. In the late afternoon I could see if my sassy grandmother was home from her job at the lamp factory in New Jersey, and when the radio next door wasn't at full blast, I could hear my aunt, who also lived across the courtyard, yelling after my teenage nephew from her window.</p><p><span>There were also moments when it was quiet, </span><span>when kids were at school, people were at work, </span><span>and the merengue-loving neighbors were </span><span>taking their afternoon siesta.</span> In one of those rare quiet moments, I remember having a revelation while staring at a draft of my first novel on my desk, that if I had waited to tell my story until I had a room of my own, as opposed to a place that always brimmed with people, I would never have finished that novel.</p><p>But even more so, without all the family members, <span>who showed up with leftovers and slipped </span><span>$20 in my hand when I looked tired from long </span><span>nights at freelance jobs teaching, editing and </span><span>even window-designing while \"estudiando\" for </span><span>my master\u2019s degree, I wouldn\u2019t have had the </span><span>confidence that I was right to continue to live </span><span>my life as a writer. It was the spirit of all that </span><span>collective activity inside that apartment with </span><span>elastic walls that gave birth to my first novel.</span></p>", "question": "10.

A Danish chemist and a German chemist </span><span>simultaneously extracted this metal from the ancient </span><span>astringent alum around 1825. (Alum is the powder cartoon </span><span>characters like Sylvester the cat sometimes swallow </span><span>that makes their mouths pucker.) Because of its </span><span>luster, mineralogists immediately classified aluminium </span><span>as a precious metal, like silver or platinum, worth hundreds </span><span>of dollars an ounce.</span></p>\n<p>Twenty years later, a Frenchman figured out how <span>to scale up these methods for industry, making aluminium </span><span>available commercially. For a price. It was still </span><span>more expensive than even gold. That\u2019s because, despite </span><span>being the most common metal in the earth\u2019s crust\u2014</span><span>around 8 percent of it by weight, hundreds of millions </span><span>of times more common than gold\u2014aluminium never </span><span>appears in pure, mother lode-al form. It\u2019s always </span><span>bonded to something, usually oxygen. Pure samples </span><span>were considered miracles. The French once displayed </span><span>Fort Knox\u2013like aluminium bars next to their crown </span><span>jewels, and the minor emperor Napoleon III reserved a </span><span>prized set of aluminium cutlery for special guests at </span><span>banquets. (Less favored guests used gold knives and </span><span>forks.) In the United States, government engineers, to </span><span>show off their country\u2019s industrial prowess, capped the </span><span>Washington Monument with a six-pound pyramid of </span><span>aluminium in 1884. A historian reports that one ounce </span><span>of shavings from the pyramid would have paid a day's </span><span>wages for each of the laborers who erected it.</span></p><p><span>Aluminium's sixty-year reign as the world's most </span><span>precious substance was glorious, but so</span>on an American chemist ruined everything. The metal's properties\u2014light, strong, attractive\u2014tantalized manuf<span>acturers, and </span><span>its omnipresence in the earth's crust had the potential to </span><span>revolutionize metal production. It obsessed people, but </span><span>no one could figure out an efficient way to separate it </span><span>from oxygen. At Oberlin College in Ohio, a chemistry </span><span>professor named Frank Fanning Jewett would regale his </span><span>students with tales of th</span>e aluminium E1 Dorado t<span>hat awaited whoever mastered this element. And at least </span><span>one of his students had the na\u00efvet\u00e9 to take his professor </span><span>seriously.</span></p><p>In his later years, Professor Jewett bragged to old college chums that \"my greatest discovery was the discovery of a man\"\u2014Charles Hall. Hall worked with Jewett on separating aluminium throughout his undergraduate years at Oberlin. He failed and failed and failed again, but failed a little more smartly each time. Finally, in 1886, Hall ran an electric current from handmade batteries (power lines didn\u2019t exist) through a liquid with dissolved aluminium compounds. The energy from the current zapped and liberated the pure metal, which collected in minute silver nuggets on the bottom of the tank. The process was cheap and easy, and it would work just as well in huge vats as on the lab bench. This had been the most sought-after chemical prize since the philosopher\u2019s stone, and Hall had found it. The \"aluminium boy wonder\" was just twenty-three.</p><p><span>Hall's fortune, however, was not made instantly. </span><span>Chemist Paul H\u00e9roult in France <b class=\"now\">stumbled</b> on more or </span><span>less the same process at the same time. (Today Hall and </span><span>H\u00e9roult share credit for the discovery that crashed the </span><span>aluminium market.) An Austrian invented another separation </span><span>method in 1887, and with the competition </span><span>bearing down on Hall, he quickly founded what became </span><span>the Aluminum Company of America, or Alcoa, in </span><span>Pittsburgh. It turned into one of the most successful </span><span>business ventures in history.</span></p><p>Aluminium production at Alcoa grew at exponential <span>rates. In its first months in 1888, Alcoa eked out </span><span>50 pounds of aluminium per day; two decades later, it </span><span>had to ship 88,000 pounds per day to meet the demand. </span><span>And while production soared, prices plummeted. Years </span><span>before Hall was born, one man\u2019s breakthrough had </span><span>dropped aluminium from $550 per pound to $18 per </span><span>pound in seven years. Fifty years later, not even adjusting </span><span>for inflation, Hall's company drove down the price </span><span>to 25 cents per pound.
