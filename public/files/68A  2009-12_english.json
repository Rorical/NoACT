The mathematical theorem that now bears her last name(65) helped <b>lie the foundation for</b> quantum physics and allowed Einstein to formulate his theory of general relativity.</p><p>In literature, author Gertrude Stein epitomized originality. Her writing initially shocked readers because it departed from conventional grammar, storytelling, and style. Stein separated words from their fixed mcanings. She used words not as representations of reality but <span>as pure forms, </span><b>as if</b><span> they were musical notes. Yet, as </span><span>innovative as she was, </span><b>borrowed</b><span> from the world of </span><span>visual art, </span><b>particularly</b><span> from the Cubist painters. </span><span>Stein </span><b>remarked, that</b><span> she was doing in writing what Pablo Picasso was doing in painting.</span></p><p>It's often difficult to trace an innovation <b>as</b> a single origin.
