Scientists estimated that water temperatures ranged from 700\u00b0 C in the deepest part of a vent to 10\u00b0 C at the top of a vent (the seafloor opening). Laboratory experiments have shown that temperature <i>gradients</i> (increases or decreases in temperature in relationship to distance) promote chemical reactions. This natural temperature gradient provided the optimum conditions for the following events. Inorganic molecules were heated in the deep part of the vents, creating organic molecules. Seawater circulating through the vents cooled and preserved these organic molecules, which were then deposited onto clay lining the top of the vents.
