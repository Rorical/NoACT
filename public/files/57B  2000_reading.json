When ranchers talk </span><span>about wolves they say, \"You know, it\u2019s not the wolves </span><span>we\u2019re worried about, it\u2019s what the wolves represent; it\u2019s </span><span>not what they\u2019ll do, it\u2019s what they mean.\" Wolves mean </span><span>changes. Wolves mean challenges to the old ways of </span><span>doing things. Wolves mean loss of control.</span></p><p>Ranchers deserve our compassion and our con<span>cern. Whether the threat of wolves is imagined or </span><span>actual, the ranchers\u2019 fear and anger are real. </span></p><p><span>Ranchers claim that wolves will devastate the live\u0002</span><span>stock industry in the West. Yet all the studies show that </span><span>wolves kill far less than 1 percent of the livestock avail</span><span>able to them. According to the </span><span><i>Bozeman Chronicle</i>, </span><span>even if federal specialists have wildly underestimated </span><span>the number of cows and sheep that wolves would kill in </span><span>the Yellowstone and central Idaho areas, the actual total </span><span>would be much smaller than the number that die each </span><span>year in the state of Montana alone because of storms, </span><span>dogs, and accidents.</span></p><p>In effect, the livestock industry has successfully <span>transferred to the general public one of its most basic </span><span>operational costs: prevention of predator losses. If you </span><span>raise Christmas trees, part of the cost and risk of doing </span><span>business is losing a few trees to gypsy moths and ice </span><span>storms; inherent in the cost of ranching, particularly on </span><span>public lands, should be the cost and risk of losing live\u0002</span><span>stock to predators. Instead, every year 36 million tax </span><span>dollars go to kill native predators on our public lands so </span><span>that private industry can make a profit.</span></p><p>It is important to remember that wolves are <span>missing from the Yellowstone region only because we </span><span>eliminated them. They did not vanish from the area in </span><span>response to loss of prey or lack of habitat; they did not </span><span>die out as a result of disease or natural catastrophe. We </span><span>systematically, intentionally, consciously killed every </span><span>wolf we could find.</span></p><p>Opponents of wolf reintroduction assume that <span>because there are no wolves, there should be no wolves. </span><span>They have promoted the idea that the return of wolves </span><span>is somehow radical or extreme, some sort of environ</span><span>mental luxury, some romantic nonsense that only </span><span>urbanites and rich Easterners advocate at the expense of </span><span>the poor, beleaguered Western livestock industry. (In </span><span>fact, surveys show that Westerners support the reintro</span><span>duction.) The industry\u2019s cry of economic loss has </span><span>eclipsed the costs to the general public of not having </span><span>wolves. In the West we now live in a \"wolf-free\" envi</span><span>ronment. Or is it \"wolf-deprived\"? Who has gained and </span><span>who has lost? How do we assign a value to the impor</span><span>tance of a predator in the ecosystem? How do we deter</span><span>mine the cost of removing one note from a Mozart </span><span>symphony, one sentence from a Tolstoy novel, or one </span><span>brush stroke from a Rembrandt? Having wolves in </span><span>Yellowstone is not a luxury but a right. We should not </span><span>have to pay for clean air or water, nor should we believe </span><span>that they are somehow a luxury. Similarly, we have a </span><span>right to a full complement of wildlife on our public </span><span>lands.</span></p><p>Emotions, not facts, have controlled the wolf <span>debate. Wolves have never been just wolves: the wolf is </span><span>the devil\u2019s keeper, the slayer of innocent children, the </span><span>nurturer of abandoned babies, the sacred hunter, the </span><span>ghostly creature of myth and legend. In short, wolves </span><span>are symbolic; Yellowstone is symbolic; restoring </span><span>wolves to Yellowstone is a deeply and profoundly sym</span><span>bolic act.</span></p><p>We are a culture of symbols. It is not surprising <span>that ranchers and environmentalists use the symbolic </span><span>force of wolves to debate painful changes. We use sym</span><span>bols to help us order and make sense of an increasingly </span><span>complex world. The Yellowstone wolf-recovery debate </span><span>is fundamentally an expression of a culture in transi</span><span>tion; it is the struggle that accompanies old assumptions </span><span>clashing against the new. The story of this conflict is </span><span>the story of how we view ourselves in relation to ani</span><span>mals, whether we can replace the assumption of </span><span>\"dominion\" that has been so destructive to us and the </span><span>natural world with a worldview that recognizes that we </span><span>live in a state of reciprocity with the birds and the </span><span>beasts\u2014that we are not only the product of nature but </span><span>also part of it.</span></p>", "question": "11.

The next day it was raining, and my family </span><span>and I set off for India. Watch out for the cows, wrote </span><span>my favorite English teacher, tongue-in-cheek, in my </span><span>yearbook. I\u2019d keep a wary eye out, I thought, packing a </span><span>dozen cassettes on which I\u2019d recorded my favorite </span><span>music. My friends stood in the rain with a banner pro</span><span>claiming <i>Goodbye, Indira!</i> </span><span>I was a heroine, a star for </span><span>the moment. I was leaving the country. </span></p><p><span>Though I\u2019d been born there, I didn\u2019t want to go to </span><span>India. What I wanted was to knock on a Broadway pro</span><span>ducer\u2019s door and say, \"I\u2019m brown, I\u2019m talented, let me </span><span>write you a play.\" My parents, however, believed I </span><span>needed to embrace my Indian past. I wanted only to </span><span>escape it, as I wanted to escape anything that spoke to </span><span>me of tradition or old-fashioned ideas. I was too cool </span><span>for India.</span></p><p>I remember the heat in Bombay\u2019s airport, so thick <span>it was sliceable; the crush of people who wanted to help </span><span>after our car developed engine trouble on our way </span><span>home; the glare of the outdoors; the cool dark of the </span><span>interiors. My uncle\u2019s family welcomed my mother and </span><span>me into their home in Madras, a city on the south\u0002</span><span>eastern part of the subcontinent, famed for its music </span><span>festivals and its beach. In Madras I enrolled in a </span><span>Catholic women\u2019s college. Nuns were the teachers, the </span><span>English language was the norm.</span></p><p>In high school I had edited an underground news<span>paper, bought my first copy of <i>The Village Voice</i></span><span>, read</span><span><i>The New York Times</i> regularly. I believed I was a femi</span><span>nist. In India I was unsure of my role. Above all, I was </span><span>deeply worried that I\u2019d be married off, that I\u2019d be </span><span>forced to become a housewife, horror of horrors, and </span><span>would lose my freedom.</span></p><p>What I discovered in India: people who looked <span>like me. Girls who befriended me instantly. Girls who </span><span>told me the truth at once. I was an American, and how </span><span>everyone knew that\u2014for they all did\u2014escaped me. </span><span>Wasn\u2019t I as brown as they? Or was I giving off an </span><span>American aura, wearing Wrangler jeans and a T-shirt, </span><span>speaking hesitant Tamil?</span></p><p>I attended a wedding. I watched some of the <span>funeral preparations following the death of my great </span><span>uncle. I climbed 500 steps to reach a Jain temple where </span><span>a priest gave me a blessing that translated roughly as \"</span><span>You will have seven years of good luck followed by </span><span>seven years more of the same.\" During a ten-day tour of </span><span>famous temples, I saw a snake charmer in a parking lot </span><span>and visited an entire city of priests and ascetics. They </span><span>let us into a temple\u2019s sanctum sanctorum, where we saw </span><span>the God image in all its splendor.</span></p><p>In India I had the unswerving consideration of my <span>relatives, 25 of whom I met in my first six months. I </span><span>remember our meals together, and the preparations: the </span><span>pile of freshly shredded coconut\u2014white, flaky, fragrant </span><span>with milk; the way sweet dough for <i>jellabies</i> </span><span>would be </span><span>dropped in hot oil and bob up to perfection. In America </span><span>I picked at pizza and baked ziti on the school lunch </span><span>menu; in India I feasted. There were scores of delicious </span><span>meals, piles of snacks in tins, water always available in </span><span>an earthen vessel in the kitchen.</span></p><p>And still I felt I was missing out on a superlative <span>year in America, and I was determined to dislike India. </span><span>I dragged my aunt to see a Woody Allen movie and felt </span><span>it superior to Indian films, even though they managed to </span><span>reduce me to tears.</span></p><p>In all of this, I, the <i>yanqui</i>, was a source of amuse<span>ment to the family. They bent over backward to please </span><span>me that year, and I finally admitted to enjoying myself. </span><span>I can still recall the din of the streets as I rushed to col</span><span>lege in the mornings\u2014bicycles, rickshaws, buses, </span><span>pedestrians, bikes and yes, even a bull here and there.</span></p><p>Now a teacher myself in San Diego, I have just <span>come back from giving a class on \"the travel essay.\" </span><span>One of my students suggested that the writer we were </span><span>studying had formed her opinion of the country she was </span><span>visiting before traveling there.
