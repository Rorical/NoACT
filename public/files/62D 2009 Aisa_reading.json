This paper was a model of clarity, Richard told his students. It represented everything that science should be.<br/><br/> Richard paced in front of the chalkboard, speaking easily and without notes. Like the minor evolutionist Robert Chambers, he had been born hexadactylic; he was sensitive about his left hand, which was somewhat scarred from the childhood operation that had removed his extra finger.

From the back of the room, where I sat when I came each fall to hear him lecture, I could watch the students listen to him.<br/><br/> After he passed out the paper, Richard told the students his first, conventional version of Gregor Mendel's life. Mendel, he said, grew up in a tiny village in the northwestern corner of Moravia, which was then a part of the Hapsburg Empire and later became part of Czechoslovakia. When he was twenty-one, poor and desperate for further education, he entered the Augus tinian monastery in the capital city of Brunn, which is now called Brno.

For his laboratory he used a little strip of garden adjoining the monastery wall.<p><br/></p>Over the next eight years Mendel performed hundreds of experiments on thousands of plants, tracing the ways in which characteristics were passed through generations. Tall and short plants, with white or violet flowers; peas that were wrinkled or smooth; pods that were arched or constricted around the seeds. He kept meticulous records of his hybridizations in order to write the paper the students now held in their hands. On a clear, cold evening in 1865, he read the first part of this paper to his fellow members of the Brunn Society <span>for the Study of Natural Science. About forty men were present, a few professional scientists and many serious amateurs. Mendel read to them for an hour, describing his experiments and demonstrating the invariable ratios with which traits appeared in his hybrids. A month later, at the Society's next meeting, he presented the theory he'd formulated to account for his results.</span><p><br/> Right there, my husband said, right in that small, crowded room, the science of genetics was born. Mendel knew nothing of genes or chromosomes or DNA, but he'd discovered the principles that made the search for those things possible.<br/><br/>\"Was there applause?\" Richard always asked at this point. \"Was there a great outcry of approval or even a mutter of disagreement?\" A rhetorical question; the students knew better than to answer.<br/><br/>\"There was not. The minutes of that meeting show hat no questions were asked and no discussion took place. Not one person in that room understood the significance of what Mendel had presented.

Eventually he was elected abbot of his monastery, and from that time until his death he was occupied with his administrative duties.

She had been away from the United States for nearly two and a half years and Hurok, uncertain of the audience she would draw, chose the smaller theater for her homecoming rather than the more prestigious Carnegie Hall. One can only wonder whether he foresaw the extraordinary potential of the contralto singer whom he had agreed to manage, or the remarkable relationship they would enjoy.<br/><br/> By 1939, after only five concert seasons, Anderson had more than duplicated in America what she had achieved in Europe. In America, her fees had risen from $400 to $2,000 for most performances. With more engagements for Anderson than she could comfortably fulfill. Hurok's job was now \"not to seek dates for Marian, but to winnow out the most attractive ones each season.\" To meet the repertoire needs of constantly expanding seasons, which included yearly appearances in many cities, she had to change programs more rapidly. In developing her repertoire, she had the help of a network of teachers on both sides of the Atlantic. She added an abundance of new material, exploring the more unusual, even esoteric byways of the vocal literature. Her programs had a striking cosmopolitanism, which she liked to emphasize particularly in her Carnegie Hall recitals. For her first recital there in 1939, she chose music by Spanish composers, a group of French chansons, a Tchaikovsky aria, music by American composers, and spirituals.<br/><br/> In only five seasons with Hurok, Anderson had become an indelible part of the American musical scene. Occasionally a critic preferred to maintain some appearance of sobriety in response to an Anderson concert. Olin Downes, for example, never comfortable with extravagant praise, held to his gravity of manner in reviewing Anderson's first New York recital in 1939: \"Miss Anderson sings music by classic masters, not as a lesson learned, or a duty carefully performed, but as an interpreter who has fully grasped and deeply felt the import of the song.\" For the rest, critics threw caution to the winds, outdoing each other in their efforts to capture the excitement generated by Anderson's appearances. From New York to Buffalo to Milwaukee Anderson was rewarded with a triumphal chorus of brilliant reviews.</p><p>Of course, there was much more to Anderson's success than voice and art. In her every appearance, the unique qualities of her character and personality made themselves felt just as strongly as her technique and interpretations. Perhaps, in the end, what touched audiences most deeply was the provocative contradiction between the effortless warmth, sincerity, and dignity Anderson radiated and the quality of aloofness that was always present. The critic Glenn Dillard Gunn, after one of her Washington recitals, provided a moving portrait of Anderson's compelling hold on the imagination of her audiences: \"Miss Anderson's power to move her listeners as can no other singer of her generation is not so made less by the simple, almost unsmiling dignity which clothes her like a garment. She holds herself aloof and doubtless with intention. Her eyes closed, her face expressionless, she retires into her world of song, inviting us to enter it, but remaining remote, not sharing her personality. Even in her moment of triumph the barrier is there.\"<br/><br/> Radio helped introduce Anderson's voice across America. With the waning of the economic hardships left behind by the Depression, radio opportunities for classical artists increased significantly. During the late thirties, her voice could be heard on such programs as the General Motors Hour, the Magic Key program and the Ford Hour. Her striking voice, never more opulent than in those years; the range of her programs, which included, in addition to spirituals, more popular numbers than she normally sang on concert programs: and the charm and radiance of her personality, so intimately bound up with her singing, made her an extraordinarily popular radio performer.<br/><br/> In the black community, Anderson's accomplishments as a singer and the sense of pride and purpose she inspired brought her many honors. In January 1939, the NAACP announced that it would award Anderson the Spingarn Medal, given annually by its president.

The dates are essential to any understanding of the book, to its survival for over fifty years and its continued influence. There is no excitement for a writer like that of living in rebellious times. At least before World War II broke out, my work in progress was very much the product of and a response to the social crises of the 30s. The massive breakdown of the American economy in the depression was the greatest national crisis after the Civil War, and I lived in its very midst, tossed up and down in the stormy ocean of the times by the suffering of my unemployed working-class parents, the mass social protests all over the country, the triumph of Fascism in Germany, Italy, and Spain, and the extremism in America itself of Communist and Fascist geologies in violent conflict.<br/><br/> What Walt Whitman wrote about the Civil War in \"Drum-taps\" could have been said of the '30s:</p><p><h5 id=\"94jrb\"><span>Long, too long America,<br/>Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and<br/>prosperity only.<br/>But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing grappling with direst fate and recoiling not.<br/>And now to conceive and show to the world what your children enmasse really are....</span></h5><br/> A history of modern American prose literature begun in such a period and continued out of a sense of social crisis during the great global war against Fascism! The literary significance of this is that I believed in what essayist William Hazlitt called the \"spirit of the age\"\u2014meaning that <i>this</i> age we were living in had a character all its own and could be related  to other ages and periods, thus constituting a historical scene in which a period was known through its writers and its writers through their period.<br/><br/> Of all my books, <i>On Native Grounds</i> was the easiest to write. I felt what have never felt since 1945\u2014that the age was wholly with me, that I was appealing to \"the spirit of the age,\" that the writers as characters in my book were friends and the most encouraging people in the world to write about. I was writing literary <i>history</i>, a genre long abandoned by critics and now suspect (history can no longer be characterized and summed up as confidently as it was in the 30s and early 40s by the young man who wrote this book). This means that I saw connections everywhere between history and literature. I saw connections between the writers themselves as fellow-spirits and artists relating to the pressures of American life.<br/><br/> My subject was the emergence of the \"modern\" in an American literature obviously unsettled by relentless <span>new forces in every sphere: social, intellectual, and religious. My perspective, so natural in the turbulent 30s, was based on a spirit of social protest shared with almost every writer in my book.</span></p><p>There was nothing strange or unexpected in 1938 about my being both critical of \"the system\" and crazy about the country. What drew me to the serious study of American literature within a historical context was the <i>narrative</i> it suggested on every hand. America from its beginnings as \"our rising empire\" (George Washington) embodied a purposeful form of historical movement, unprecedented on such a continental scale, that cried out to be written as a great story. In the background of the particular story I was writing was the sense, which was everywhere at the end of the nineteenth century, of a new age. What struck me from the first was the astonishment with which American writers confronted situations as new to themselves as to the Europeans who were often reading about America for the first time.<br/><br/> What gave me the confidence at twenty-three to begin a book like this? The age, the insurgency of the times, but above all On Native Grounds represents my personal discovery of America.
