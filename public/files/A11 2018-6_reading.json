It felt as if a city had been added to the coast, better lit than any  town or village. He went up the gangplank, watching only the path of his feet\u2014\u2014nothing ahead of him existed\u2014\u2014and continued till he faced the dark harbour and sea. There were outlines of other ships farther out, beginning to turn on lights. He stood alone, smelling  everything, then came back through the noise and the crowd to the side that faced land. A yellow glow over the city. Already it felt there was a wall between him and what took place there. Stewards began handing out food and cordials. He ate several sandwiches, and after  that he made his way down to his cabin, undressed, and slipped into the narrow bunk. He'd never slept under a blanket before, save once in Nuwara Eliya. He was wide awake. The cabin was below the level of the waves, so there was no porthole. He found a switch  beside the bed and when he pressed it his head and pillow were suddenly lit by a cone of light. </p><p>He did not go back up on deck for a last look, or to wave at his relatives who had brought him to the harbour. He could hear singing and imagined the slow and  then eager parting of families talking place in the thrilling night air. I do not know, even now, why he chose this solitude. Had whoever brought him onto the <i>Oronsay</i> already left? In films people tear themselves away from one another weeping, and the ship separates  from land while the departed hold on to those disappearing faces until all distinction is lost. </p><p>I try to imagine who the boy on the ship was. Perhaps a sense of self is not even there in his nervous stillness in the narrow bunk, in this green grasshopper  or little cricket, as if he been smuggled away accidentally, with no knowledge of the act into the future. </p><p>What had there been before such a ship in my Iife? A dugout canoe on a river journey? A launch in Trincomalee harbour? There were always fishing boats on our  horizon. But I could never have imagined the grandeur of this castle that was to cross the sea. The longest journeys I had made were car rides to Nuwara Eliya and Horton Plains, or the train to Jaffna, which we boarded at seven a.m. and disembarked from in the late afternoon.  We made that journey with our egg sandwiches, a pack of cards, and a small Boy's Own adventure. </p><p>But now it had been arranged I would be travelling to England by ship, and that I would be making the journey alone. No mention was made that this might be  an unusual experience or that it could be exciting or dangerous, so I did not approach it with any joy or fear. I was not forewarned that the ship would have seven levels, hold more than six hundred people including a captain, nine cooks, engineers, a veterinarian, and that  it would contain a small jail and chlorinated pools that would actually sail with us over two oceans. The departure date was marked casually on the calendar by my aunt, who had notified the school that I would be leaving at the end of the end of the term. The fact of my being at sea  for twenty-one days was spoken of as having not much significance, so I was surprised my relatives were even bothering to accompany me to the harbour. I had assumed I would be taking a bus by myself and then change onto another at Borella Junction. </p><p>There had been just one attempt to introduce me to the situation of the journey. A lady named Flavia Prins, whose husband knew my uncle, turned out to be making the same journey and was invited to tea one afternoon to meet with me. She would be travelling in First Class  but promised to keep an eye on me. I shook her hand carefully, as it was covered with rings and bangles, and she then turned away to continue the conversation I had interrupted. I spent most of the hour listening to a few uncles and counting how many of the trimmed sandwiches  they ate. </p><p>On my last day, I found an empty school examination booklet, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, a traced map of the world, and put them into my small suitcase. </p><p>As I got into the car, it was explained to me that  after I'd crossed the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, and gone through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean, I would arrive one morning on a small pier in England and my mother would meet me there.

Tourist trap restaurants, shops, cooking classes, and at times it seemed the whole of the French Quarter, were given  over to providing visitors with what they expected to find. There was no regard for whether the offerings were authentic New Orleans food or culture. Suddenly andouille sausage became the local standard even though most New Orleanians had never heard of it.

The tendency to find foreign food more desirable is a prejudice that  goes back centuries\u2014\u2014to a time when the Russian aristocracy spoke French, not Russian.

So he decided to measure<span> <i>e</i>, the charge on the electron. </span></p><p>Millikan\u2019s idea was simple. A droplet of water that had been given an electric charge would be attracted to a metal plate which carried an opposite charge. He arranged his apparatus so that the electrical attraction pulled the droplet up, while gravity pulled it down. This gave him a way to measure <i>e</i>. First he would find the mass of the droplet. Then he would measure the voltage needed for the attraction to the metal plate to cancel out the downward pull of gravity. From those two pieces of information he could get a measure of the charge on the droplet.  </p><p>The experiment was far from simple to carry out, however. Finding that the water droplets tended to evaporate before any measurements could be made, Millikan set to the task of trying the same trick with oil droplets. </p><p>In 1910, at the age of forty-two, he finally published a value for <i>e</i>. It was meant to be his career-defining publication. Eventually, it was\u2014but Millikan still had years of difficult and dirty work ahead of him. </p><p>The Austrian physicist Felix Ehrenhaft refuted Millikan\u2019s results with a similar set experiments that seemed to show that electrical charge can be infinitely small. There is no fundamental, minimum unit of charge, Ehrenhaft said; there is no \u2018electron\u2019. The series of experiments the desperate Millikan then performed were to cast a lasting shadow over his scientific integrity. </p><p>According to biologist Richard Lewontin, Millikan \u2018went out of his way to hide the existence of inconvenient data\u2019. David Goodstein, a physics professor, says Millikan \u2018certainly did not commit scientific fraud\u2019. So where does the truth lie? </p><p>The debate <b class=\"now\">hangs on</b> a phrase in Millikan\u2019s 1913 paper refuting Ehernhaft and showing that every measurement of electric charge gives a value of <i>e</i><span> or an integer multiple of <i>e</i>. In his 1913 paper, Millikan says that his data table \u2018<i>contains a complete summary of the results obtained on all of the 58 different drops upon which complete series of observations were made</i>\u2019. The statement is written in italics, as if to give it special weight. The notebooks for the 1913 paper show that Millikan actually took data on 100 oil droplets. Did Millikan cherry-pick the data in order to confirm his original result and crush Ehrenhaft underfoot? </span></p><p>He certainly had motive. In Millikan\u2019s 1910 paper he had made the \u2018mistake\u2019 of full disclosure with statements such as, \u2018Although all of these observations gave values of<span> <i>e</i> within 2 percent of the final mean, the uncertainties of the observations were such that \u2026.I felt obliged to discard them\u2019. This admirable honesty about the selection of data points had given Ehrenhaft ammunition that he used enthusiastically in his long feud with Millikan, Perhaps, with the italicized statement, Millikan was making sure that he gave his foe no more. </span></p><p>That would certainly explain something that is otherwise inexplicable. Millikan aborted the experimental run on twenty-five of the droplets in the work reported in the 1913 paper. According to Goodstein, Millikan preferred to use droplets that showed a change in charge, gaining or losing an electron (as he saw it) during the measurement. Millikan may also have judged some droplets to be too small or too large to yield reliable data, Goodstein says. If they were too large, they would fall too rapidly to be reliably observed. Too small, and their fall (and thus the charge result) would be affected by random collisions with air molecules. Goodstein interprets the italicized statement as an assertion that there were only fifty-eight \u2018complete enough\u2019 sets of data. </p><p>But Goodstein undoes his defence by stating that in order to make the \u2018too large\u2019 or \u2018too small\u2019 distinction,<span> <i>all</i> the data would need to have been taken in first place. </span></p><p>Millikan certainly did not convince his peers straight away. The arguments with Ehrenhaft rumbled on long enough for Millikan\u2019s Nobel Prize to be delayed for three years\u2014\u2014it eventually came in 1923. </p><p> But here\u2019s the point: Millikan was right about the electron and its charge. Few laboratories managed to replicate Ehrenhaft\u2019s result, but students now replicate Millikan\u2019s results, all across the world. No one now believes that fundamental unit of charge is anything other than Millikan\u2019s<span> <i>e</i>. </span></p><p>To get his Nobel Prize, Millikan had to play hard and fast with what we might call \u2018accepted practice\u2019.</p>", "question": "40.
