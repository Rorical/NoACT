Each polynucleotide is then fragmented along the length of the sugar-phosphate backbone into many short, single-stranded polynucleotide fragments. Each fragment serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary fragment. The fragments then combine so that, after replication, each DNA molecule contains many pieces of parental DNA and many pieces of new DNA (Figure 4).</span></p><p><img height=\"372.09\" src=\"https://ame-1253155612.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2bd97f54793fe2c6cb7066abff44feff\" width=\"348.46\"/><span><br/></span></p>", "question": "40.
