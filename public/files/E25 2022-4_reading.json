To me, its iconic stylized rooster logo conveyed a positive and bright outlook for the betterment of children.

I see now how the seeds to express my thoughts and ideas through pictures were sown. Out of the endearing timesI spent with my little collection sprung the desire to illustrate books, to use calligraphy and hand-written text.

These happened to be illustrated by an important figure from my childhood: Gholamali Maktabi, someone I hadn't thought of in years. I never until now got the message of the giving of all these books, first by my father and again by my mother. I had tucked Maktabi's wonderful books away in my memory all of these years and not until the idea for this essay presented itself, did I bring them out into the light. And he came out along with them.</span></p><p><span>Gholamali Maktabi was my father's dear and lifelong friend from their school days. He was a part of our family and we endearingly called him \u201cDhayee Maktabi,\u201d which means Uncle Maktabi in Farsi. I remember a sense of warmth always surrounding that name. I knew him first as the person behind the poignant, sensitive photographs taken of us in Iran as we were growing up. The images he recorded have served time and again as windows into my childhood, my personality as a child, images that connect me with who I was.His innate ability to capture with such simplicity and affection the smile or frown of a child can also be seen in his lifework as an illustrator of children's books. Dhayee Maktabi would spend time drawing with my sister and me when we were children.</span></p><p><span>In October 2007, after more than 30 years, I called Dhayee Maktabi.

I've spent about forty years illustrating children's and adolescents' books and I expect that I will continue to do this for the foreseeable future. The thing that has always attracted me to illustrating for children and adolescents is the world that they inhabit, one which is full of mysteries and secrets.\u201d</span></p><p><span>Indeed, I believe that those photographic portraits of my family done long ago also served this purpose.

Houck (\u00a92010 by UniversityPress of Mississippi).</p><p><span>The Mississippi River batture is unique. Here we have a place that is neither water nor land; it is both. It depends on the time of year. Spanish and French traditions going back to the time of Rome recognized public rights to public things. The civil code declared that rivers and their banks were public, which would have closed the matter. But in the late 1700s along came Edward Livingston, a New Yorker with an American notion of private property, a keen legal mind, a nose for money, and an ambition as big as the Ritz.</span></p><p><span>Livingston's accomplishments in the courthouse and the legislature remain monuments today, but the case that made him famous was about dirt on the banks of the Mississippi at a prime location in downtown New Orleans. Livingston and his client who claimed the dirt stood to make a fortune. Indeed, Livingston declined a fee in the case. Instead, if he won he would get a piece of the victory, the most valuable real estate in New Orleans.</span></p><p><span>The American notion of property was not popular in New Orleans, whose people were accustomed to using the banks of rivers to beach their boats, promenade, fish, swim, rake mussels, and even take fill for their front yards. By precedent rising from centuries, the Mississippi batture was common ground. In a city oppressed by heat, the batture was also treasured ground, the place where everyone in society from cotton brokers to boat hands could enjoy the breeze, air pleasant to inhale, and the very sight of the river. When Livingston's client undertook to develop the batture he was claiming, a public mob arrived to interrupt his work. Every day.</span></p><p><span>Livingston's client made a frontal assault. He went </span><span>out at low water, diked off the batture, and then arrested people coming to take the river sand in the old and accustomed way. The ensuing lawsuits rivaled the twists and turns of a Dickens novel. On one side was Livingston, claiming that private property was sacred in America. On the other was a who's who of wellborn local names right on up to the president of the United States. Thomas Jefferson considered the public character of the Mississippi to be a civic right and essential to his ambitions for settling the West. After Livingston won his first case, Jefferson had U.S. marshals evict him from the batture anyway, at which point Livingston sued the officer who evicted him. It got that bad.</span></p><p><span>When the dust settled, years later, Livingston emerged with his property deed, but he had ceded important claims to the city, including part of his real estate and development controls on the rest. Compromise that it was, the New Orleans batture would go from small wharves and open space to an impressive accumulation of mega-wharves and warehouses. New </span><span>Orleaneans not only could no longer access the river; they could no longer even see it.</span></p><p><span>Enter Robert Livingston, Edward's brother, with an even more impressive list of accomplishments and a yet bigger coup in mind. He and Robert Fulton, who had either invented the steamboat or made a quick copy of someone else's, depending on your source, tendered an offer to New Orleans that it could not refuse, a monopoly on the Mississippi River.</span></p><p><span>Fulton's steamboat had one huge advantage for the future of the city; it could go upriver.

Nearly six decades after the work came into the world, \u201c4'33\u201d\" is still dismissed as \u201cabsolutely ridiculous,\u201d \u201cstupid,\u201d and \u201ca gimmick.\u201d Such judgments are especially common within classical music where Cage, who died in 1992, remains an object of widespread scorn.</span></p><p>Morton Feldman, another avant-garde musician, once said, \u201cJohn Cage was the first composer in the history of music who raised the question by implication that maybe music could be an art form rather than a musical form.\u201d Feldman meant that, since the Middle Ages, even the most adventurous composers had labored within a craftsmanlike tradition. Cage held that an artist can work as freely with sound as with paint: he changed what it meant to be a composer, and every kid manipulating music on a laptop is in his debt. Not everything he did was laudable, or even tolerable. Yet the work remains inescapable, mesmerizing, and often unexpectedly touching. It encompasses some of the most violent sounds of the twentieth century, as well as some of the most gently beguiling. It confronts us with the elemental question of what music is, and confounds all easy answers.</p><p><span>Passage B by Daniel J. Levitin</span></p><p><span>The music of many avant-garde composers stretches the bounds of what most of us think music is. Going beyond the use of melody and harmony, and even beyond the use of instruments, these composers use recordings of found objects in the world such as jackhammers, trains, and waterfalls. They edit the recordings, play with their pitch, and ultimately combine them into an organized collage of sound with the same type of emotional trajectory\u2014the same tension and release\u2014as traditional music. Composers in this tradition are like the painters who stepped outside the boundaries of representational and realistic art\u2014the cubists, the Dadaists, many of the modern painters from Picasso to Kandinsky.</span></p><p><span>What do the music of Bach and John Cage fundamentally have in common? On the most basic level, what distinguishes Busta Rhymes's \u201cWhat's It Gonna Be?!\u201d or Beethoven's \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d Sonata from, say, the collection of sounds you'd hear standing in the middle of Times Square or those you'd hear deep in a rainforest? As the composer Edgard Var\u00e8se famously defined it, \u201cMusic is organized sound.\u201d</span></p><p>It is helpful to examine what music is made of. What are the fundamental building blocks of music? And how, when organized, do they give rise to music? The basic elements of any sound are loudness, pitch, contour, duration (or rhythm), tempo, timbre, spatial location, and reverberation. Our brains organize these fundamental perceptual attributes into higher-level concepts\u2014just as a painter arranges lines into forms. When we listen to music, we are actually perceiving multiple attributes.</p><p>Each attribute can be varied without altering the others. The difference between <i>music</i> and a random or disordered set of sounds has to do with the way these fundamental attributes combine, and the relations that form between them.</p>", "question": "30.

Because most of the genome does not encode proteins or regulate genes, most SNPs probably have no measurable effect on the individual. But if a SNP occurs in a region of the genome that does have a coding or regulating function, it may affect the structure or function of a protein or where and how much of the protein is made. In this way, SNPs can conceivably modify almost any trait, be it height, eye color, ability to digest milk, or susceptibility to diseases.</span></p><p><span>When natural selection strongly favors a particular allele, it becomes more common in the population with each generation, while the disfavored allele becomes less common. Eventually, if the environment remains stable, the beneficial allele will spread until everyone in the population carries it, at which point it has become fixed in that group.
