She was going over her lines again with the book on her knee. Bellamy turned his gaze back toward he stage, where the next supposed actor with the audacity to read for him was coming up to the mark; Bellamy frowned; this one was a green boy, his outsize trousers held up by a hank of rope. Everything on the street was turning up at his audition.<br/><br/> Behind him, in the seat next to Lily's, Charlie said, \"The hardest thing is going to be making you look like a fifty-year-old woman.

Up on the stage, Harry, who was man aging the audition, held out a piece of paper to the fidgeting boy. \"Read this.\"<br/><br/> A look of panic spread across the boy's face. He took the sheet, gave it the merest glance, and cleared his throat, and licked his lips, his pleading eyes fixed on Bellamy. \"I need a job,\" he said.</p><p><span>\"But you can't read,\" Bellamy said. \"Next.\" He</span><span> looked down at the list in front of him.</span></p><p><br/>\"Oooh,\" Eva cried, directly behind him. \"The poor thing.\"<br/><br/>\"Eva,\" Bellamy said, between his teeth. \"Next.\"</p><p>\"David!

We'll find something for you to do. Next!\"</p><p>Eva patted his shoulder. \"Good David.\" The boy beamed; he went quickly back off the stage. Harry threw Eva a dark look and went back to find the next tryout.<br/><br/>Bellamy settled into his seat. There was no use trying to relax. Everything was a mess and, O cursed spite, it was his job to order it. The reading had been awful. Harry simply could not manage Shakespearean English; Charlie took rant to new raw-throated dimensions of insincerity; even Lily had stumbled and staggered. Eva alone had done surprisingly well.<br/><br/> Bellamy turned his attention back to the stage. There was so much to be done. Earlier when they had tried the lights it took them an hour to get even half of them on, and there was almost no scenery. He tapped his fingers busily on his knee. <i>Hamlet</i> needed very little scenery; he could manage with screens.

He had a marked Rebel accent. \"It's the girls from the Brooklyn Hotel.\"<br/><br/> Bellamy, surprised, twisted to look behind him. Lily was leaning forward, staring at the white-haired man. Charlie clutched at her arm in his ritual fit of jealousy, and Eva cried, \"Oh, I remember you!\"<br/><br/> \"Is this one of the men who bothered you there?\" Bellamy said.</p><p>\"No, no,\" Lily said. \"He didn't do anything. He gave me some coffee.\" She waggled her fingers at him. \"Get on with it. We have to move, remember?\"<br/><br/> Bellamy grunted at her. She had a fine officious way of believing she was in command. Also it annoyed him that the girls insisted that they move into the new rooms at the Baldwin today, on top of everything else.

Yet for several months after July 4, 1776, the self-proclaimed United States of America looked set to go down in history as a nation that never was. That August, in the biggest battle of the Revolution, the British trounced the Continental Army on Long Island, nearly forcing an American surrender.<br/><br/> As Washington's beleaguered soldiers retreated through New Jersey, thousands of Americans loyal to King George III surged into New York City\u2014\u2014where they would remain under British protection for the rest of the war. These loyalists had no desire \"to dissolve the political bands\" with Britain, as the Declaration of Independence demanded. Instead, as they explained in a petition to British authorities, they <b class=\"now\">\"steadily and uniformly opposed\" this \"most unnatural, unprovoked Rebellion, that ever disgraced the annals of Time.\" While the rebels sought to sever the connection between Britain and the colonies, the loyalists \"most ardently wish [ed] for a restoration of that union between them.\" Where the rebels challenged the king, the loyalists staunchly upheld royal authority: they had \"borne true Allegiance to His Majesty\uff0c and the most warm and affectionate attachment to his Person and Government.\u201d</b><br/><br/> During three days in November 1776, this petition sat in Scott's Tavern, on Wall Street, to be signed by anyone who wished. A frank declaration of dependence, it completely lacks the revolutionary genius and rhetorical grace of the hallowed July 4 document. Yet in all, more than 700 people put their names to the parchment\u2014\u201412 times the number who signed the Declaration of Independence. Among the signatories were pillars of New York society: wealthy merchants who commanded vast tracts of land and capital, members of some of New York's most prominent families, and clergymen who published articulate rebuttals to rebel <span>pamphlets like Thomas Paine's <i>Common Sense</i>. But most of the names belonged to the ordinary people who made New York run.</span></p><p><br/> Loyalists are the American Revolution's guilty secret: rarely spoken of, hauntingly present. At least one in five Americans is believed to have remained loyal to Britain during the war. They expressed their opinions passively and actively: refusing to forswear allegiance to the king, signing petitions or joining loyalist military regiments\u2014\u2014as nearly 20,000 men did\u2014\u2014to defend their vision of British America. In retaliation they faced harassment from their peers. Some would suffer for their loyalty in open battle; others faced sanctions from state legislatures, which could strip them of their land and possessions, imprison them or formally banish them.<br/><br/> The Tories, as the patriots pejoratively called them, are still often caricatured as elitist and out of touch, even treacherous. Yet it bears stressing that our \"self-evident\" founding principles were not seen that way by one-fifth of the population. Many of the United States' first and most passionate critics were Americans themselves.<br/><br/> After the Revolutionary War ended, thousands of loyalists blended into the nation, and their descendants participated in shaping American society. But many\u2014\u2014as many as I in 30 Americans\u2014\u2014did not. Feeling insecure and unwelcome in the United States, and attracted by British promises of land and compensation, some 80,000 loyalists left their homes to build new lives elsewhere in the still-vigorous British Empire. About half fled north to Canada, among them more than 3, 000 black loyalists\u2014\u2014former slaves who had been granted freedom in exchange for fighting for the British\u2014\u2014and several hundred Mohawk Indians, longstanding British allies. Many loyalists entered Jamaican society as doctors, printers, merchants, and planters\u2014\u2014or tried their luck at cotton planting on the out-islands of the Bahamas.<br/><br/> Still, even as the loyalists put down roots in the British Empire, it seemed that they had not left every trace of America behind. For what should they promptly express abroad but an uncannily American desire for greater political representation\u2014\u2014much to the chagrin of British officials. Fired up by an \"American spirit of innovation,\" as one disgruntled British governor put it, loyalists clamored for participation every where from the Canadian Maritimes to the Bahamas. In some settings, they achieved it. Thanks in part to the loyalists political legacy, Canada gained limited self-government earlier than any other British colony, providing a template for later home rule and go decolonization.</p>", "question": "11.

In teaching me to swim, my grandmother took away my fear. I began to understand something outside myself\u2014\u2014the sea\u2014\u2014and consequently something about myself as well. I was no longer simply a little girl: My body had become a sea vessel\u2014\u2014sturdy, enduring, graceful.

When she told me, I was stunned. I reached into my memory trying to combine this new information with the Olympic vision I'd always kept of her. At first I'd felt disappointed, tricked, the way I used to feel when I'd learn that a favorite movie star was only five feet tall. But then I quickly realized what an incredible act of bravery it was for her to pass on to me a skill she herself had not quite mastered\u2014\u2014a skill that she knew would always bring me a sense of accomplishment. And it was more than just the swimming. It was the ability to stand on any beach anywhere and be proud of my large body, my African hair. It was <i>not</i> fearing the strong muscles in my own back; it was gaining control over my own life.</p>", "question": "30.
