The author and his grandfather, Jesse Bowman, are Abenaki Indians.</p><p>I remember my grandfather's garden. It was around back, between my grandparents' house and the small two-room building we used for storing things.</p><p><span>Another of my earliest memories is walking through the furrows of that newly plowed garden with my grandfather\u2014who seemed taller than the biggest trees then\u2014holding my hand. I could barely walk, even on level ground, but he wouldn't let me fall. I wore the same kind of overalls that he did, and people were already calling me \"Jess's Shadow.\"</span></p><p><span>That was how Lawrence Older put it one day when he was buying gasoline at my grandparents' filling station. \"Jess,\" Larry said, with a twinkle in his eye,\" that grandson of yours stays so close to you he don't hardly leave room enough for your shadow.\"</span></p><p><span>Jess's Shadow? I didn't quite understand that name. My name was Sonny. I knew that for sure. That was the name my grandparents called me by. I never heard either of them speak to me or about me by any other name.</span></p><p><span>I remember the day\u2014I could not have been more than two and a half years old\u2014when my grandfather said to me, \"Sonny, cup out yer bands.\" I held them out together, trying to make a really good cup. Carefully, taking the seeds out from the cloth sack he had slung over his shoulder, he filled my hands with kernels of golden corn. I stood there holding those seeds for him, watching as he took them, four at a time, to plant them.</span></p><p><span>\"Yer turn now,\" he said when those seeds were gone, and he held out one leathery hand filled with corn. I'd watched really carefully, so I knew what to do. I did it so well that my grandfather allowed that I was already better at it than he was. Then, as I planted my first hills of corn, he talked to me about things. He always talked more when he was in his garden.</span></p><p><span>There in his garden, as be spaded or began to hoe, he would talk about the different plants, about the birds we heard singing, about how we had to watch for the woodchucks or the rabbits or the raccoons. Sometimes he would talk about the old way of plowing with a team of horses, and he would tell me the names of the horses he'd loved\u2014the last of them dead and gone a decade before I was born. He told me how, as their plows cut their way down into the rich earth that was the same color as his face, he and bis father used to turn up arrowheads.</span></p><p><span>\"Indian arrowheads,\" he would say.</span></p><p><span>He had a name for that work of preparing his garden for the sweet corn and green beans and butternut squash we always put in. I never heard anyone else say it just the way he did until I met Grampa's younger brother Jack, many years later, when I was a grown man. \"Fitting the ground to plant.\" That is what Grampa called it. This is what Jack called it. This is what their father, Lewis Bowman, had called it. Fitting the ground to plant.</span></p><p><span>Another spring day, perhaps a year later, I was following my grandfather while he worked in the garden. He bad made a small hoe for me that year, and I was, as always, trying to do exactly what he did. Then he stopped hoeing. I stopped too and waited. I remember that I heard a bird sing just then, a long ululating song.</span></p><p><span>\"Oriole,\" my grandfather said. Then he bent over and picked something up. He brushed soil from it and went down on one knee next to me.</span></p><p><span>I leaned close to look at the dark, blocky piece of flint that filled my grandfather's broad hand.</span></p><p><span>\"Indian,\" my grandfather said. \"Axhead.\"</span></p><p><span>He hefted it first in one hand and then the other. He did it with the same care that my grandmother used when she was gathering eggs in the henhouse and putting them into the basket hung over her arm. Then he placed that axhead into my hands.</span></p><p><span>Thirty years after that day when my grandfather put the stone axhead in my hands, I understood at last why, as I held that stone, my mind had filled with images of tall corn swaying in the wind, images of women dancing as, they held the season's harvest in their hands.

In birds' eggs, after the egg cell\u2014consisting mainly of a ball of yolk-has been fertilized, it moves down the oviduct where it collects the albumen or 'egg white' and takes on its shell. The albumen is mainly a filler for protecting the embryo, but it also supplements the yolk as a valuable source of protein and a reservoir of water. Between the albumen and the shell are two parchment-like shell membranes. When they are, first formed they fit quite loosely, but during the next stage, known as 'plumping', water and salts fill out the albumen until the membranes are taut.

It consists of crystals of calcite, a form of calcium carbonate, strengthened with protein fibres which also attach it to the underlying membrane. The amount of calcium needed for each egg is about 2 grams. As no more than 25 milligrams are circulating in the blood of the hen, the balance must be mobilized from her reserves. She cannot absorb enough calcium from her food while making the egg, so she has to remove it from her bones. Birds have developed a special kind of bone, called medullary bone, which females lay down in the marrow cavity of existing bones during the weeks before laying commences and use as a source of calcium when the eggshells are being formed. Some birds even have difficulty in laying down this reserve because their diet is deficient in calcium. Shortage of calcium affects the breeding of scavenging birds, such as vultures, which have a diet of pure meat; to overcome this problem some species switch to hunting small animals, which they swallow whole, during the breeding season. Another example of the ingenious methods used by birds to provide calcium for their eggs can be seen on the Arctic tundra, where insect-eating sandpipers swallow the bones of long-dead lemmings; as a result there is more calcium in each clutch of eggs than there is in the adult's entire skeleton.</span></p><p>The shell of a hen's egg is peppered with 10,000 tiny pores, just visible to the naked eye as small depressions in the shell.

Birds have developed a special kind of bone, called medullary bone, which females lay down in the marrow cavity of existing bones during the weeks before laying commences and use as a source of calcium when the eggshells are being formed. Some birds even have difficulty in laying down this reserve because their diet is deficient in calcium. Shortage of calcium affects the breeding of scavenging birds, such as vultures, which have a diet of pure meat; to overcome this problem some species switch to hunting small animals, which they swallow whole, during the breeding season. Another example of the ingenious methods used by birds to provide calcium for their eggs can be seen on the Arctic tundra, where insect-eating sandpipers swallow the bones of long-dead lemmings; as a result there is more calcium in each clutch of eggs than there is in the adult's entire skeleton.</span></p><p>The shell of a hen's egg is peppered with 10,000 tiny pores, just visible to the naked eye as small depressions in the shell.

It is not surprising, therefore, that birds' eggs are similar to those of reptiles. The main interest in birds' eggs from an evolutionary point of view is the adaptation of the eggs of different species to particular lifestyles.</span></p><p><span>In both reptile and bird eggs, there is a large yolk which not only supplies the needs of the embryo but will also sustain the newly hatched animal until it can feed. In birds' eggs, after the egg cell\u2014consisting mainly of a ball of yolk-has been fertilized, it moves down the oviduct where it collects the albumen or 'egg white' and takes on its shell. The albumen is mainly a filler for protecting the embryo, but it also supplements the yolk as a valuable source of protein and a reservoir of water. Between the albumen and the shell are two parchment-like shell membranes. When they are, first formed they fit quite loosely, but during the next stage, known as 'plumping', water and salts fill out the albumen until the membranes are taut. The shell is then attached firmly onto the outer membrane, as can be seen when peeling a hard-boiled egg.</span></p><p><span>The innermost layer of albumen is thick and forms a hammock slung between the ends of the shell to keep the yolk suspended in the centre. Within it are two twisted cords called chalazae, which act as bearings to allow the yolk and embryo to rotate freely when the egg is turned by the parent bird in the nest. Chalazae are presumably unnecessary in reptile eggs because they are never turned, and some, such as those of tortoises, will not hatch if they are turned accidentally.</span></p><p><span>The shell takes 15 to 16 hours to form in a domestic hen. It consists of crystals of calcite, a form of calcium carbonate, strengthened with protein fibres which also attach it to the underlying membrane. The amount of calcium needed for each egg is about 2 grams. As no more than 25 milligrams are circulating in the blood of the hen, the balance must be mobilized from her reserves. She cannot absorb enough calcium from her food while making the egg, so she has to remove it from her bones. Birds have developed a special kind of bone, called medullary bone, which females lay down in the marrow cavity of existing bones during the weeks before laying commences and use as a source of calcium when the eggshells are being formed. Some birds even have difficulty in laying down this reserve because their diet is deficient in calcium. Shortage of calcium affects the breeding of scavenging birds, such as vultures, which have a diet of pure meat; to overcome this problem some species switch to hunting small animals, which they swallow whole, during the breeding season. Another example of the ingenious methods used by birds to provide calcium for their eggs can be seen on the Arctic tundra, where insect-eating sandpipers swallow the bones of long-dead lemmings; as a result there is more calcium in each clutch of eggs than there is in the adult's entire skeleton.</span></p><p>The shell of a hen's egg is peppered with 10,000 tiny pores, just visible to the naked eye as small depressions in the shell. These pores are used for the passage of oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour. Unlike a lung, however, the flow of gases cannot be regulated and relies purely on diffusion through the pores. Nevertheless, the flow must be finely attuned to the needs of the embryo. As development proceeds, more oxygen is required, but the loss of water must be kept low. The eggshell's role in regulating gas flow and water loss is shown by the arrangement of pores in different eggs\u2014quite simply, diffusion depends on the size and number of the pores. Of all the eggs studied, from the 1-gram eggs of warblers to the 1.5-kilogram ostrich eggs, the weight of the egg and hence its metabolic requirements is directly proportional to the total cross-sectional area of the pores.</p><p><span>Birds' eggs are uniform in shape when compared with the eggs of reptiles, but there are significant variations from the standard oval. Owls' eggs are noticeably more spherical than normal, while those of swifts and swallows are longer and more elliptical, although it is not obvious why this should be. Many waders have eggs shaped like old-fashioned spinning tops, blunt atone end and tapering sharply at the other. The reason for this is clear: there are usually four in a clutch and, being large for the size of the parent, they fit under its body better when packed points inward in the nest.</span></p>", "question": "40.
