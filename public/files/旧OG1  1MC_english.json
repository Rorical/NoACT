Once you have mastered a game, the challenge is gone, and <b>you must look</b> for a new game to conquer. After you learn the new game, you get bored again. The cycle keeps repeating. But in pinball, you have three factors to consider: you, the machine, and chance, which is sometimes your <b>enemy</b> sometimes your ally.
