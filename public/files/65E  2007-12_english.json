Suppose one of the writer's goals had been to describe and personalize the important role women played in the labor force during World War II. Does this essay achieve that goal?", "choices": {"A": " Yes, because it offers facts about the role played by millions of women during World War II and provides specific details about two of those women.", "B": " Yes, because it explains that Rosie the Riveter established a memorial to the women who worked in factories during World War II.", "C": " No, because it does not explain where Rosie theRiveter worked during World War II or if she continued to work after the war.", "D": " No, because it focuses on the careers of the two women who designed the Rosie the Riveter Memorial and what they based their design on."}, "correct": "A"}]}
