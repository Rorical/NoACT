It was a \u201cmodern\u201d glove in that it had shape, unlike the ancient specimens I came across in my grandfather\u2019s house that looked as if they\u2019d been fashioned for trolls and exhumed from a bog.

A baseball glove? What would I do with it? who would I play with? Boys at school? I was a girl. And what <i>was</i> I going to play with? Not a hardball: we were not having anything to do with hardballs. That\u2019s how people got their teeth knocked out and the next thing you knew there\u2019d be a broken window and \u201cI\u2019ll be out there doing my act with the putty knife.\u201d</p><p>For a week or so I fraternized with my new glove on the sly. Behind the closed door of the room I shared with my younger sister, I cradled my glove and pushed my face in it, inhaling the deep, fertile leather smell it pumped out. I kneaded it, shaped it, and slammed a ball\u2014a brand-new baseball\u2014in it. Outside the house, around the corner, out of sight, I found a clandestine battery mate, the wall of a brick college dormitory that had no windows on the lowest story. The glove activated all the baseball boilerplate I had amassed from incessant baseball-book reading. Confronting the wall, I flicked off the sign, looked in for another, slapped the glove against my thigh, wound up, and poured one in. Sometimes (if the wall was hitting) I cupped my knee with my glove, waiting for the batter to try to punch one through. I snagged the ball, pounced on it, speared it, whipped it home.</p><p>I walked around (out of sight of the house) with the glove tucked under my arm, wishing I could shove it in my back pocket like boys did in books, but of course my pants, when I was allowed to wear pants, had no pockets because my mother had made them. I wished I knew where to get neat\u2019s-foot oil, not available at Woolworth\u2019s, but no one I could confide in knew anything about that. Another thing I could not do, I might as well confess, was spit in my glove. I could direct the occasional spitting noise at the pocket, yes. But shoot a gob of spit right in there and work it in like you read about? No, T couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I brought the glove to school, placing it beside me on the old-fashioned bench seat, on top of my books\u2014 just like the boys did. In that distant day, or perhaps only in that parochial school, the boys and the girls were not allowed to play sports together at recess, and none of the girls had gloves. But we did play softball and my glove had no problem at all handling the larger sphere. It could handle anything.</p><p>Soon enough, unable to keep my love object to myself, I came clean with my parents. Fairly clean, at least: I kept the hardball under wraps, nestling a tennis ball into the glove\u2019s pocket in a prissily responsible manner. I told my father I thought I better tell him I\u2019d gotten a baseball glove. It was a really good one. He massaged it with his thumbs, sort of churning them around in the glove. The leather seemed okay, he allowed, but he said he didn\u2019t see why the glove had to look the way it did. He whapped his fist in it a few times and then look it with both hands and bent it back and forth as if to reprimand it for the affectation of its deep pocket. He entered briefly into the subject, familiar to all baseball-book readers, of infielders sitting on their gloves to keep them flat so they could turn the ball over fast. I said I knew about that.</p><p>He said, \u201cIs this the best you can do for a ball?\u201d I told him that actually I had bought a baseball, but that I only used it against the side of the brick dormitory\u2014you know the wall that doesn\u2019t have any windows low down you could accidentally hit.

It could handle anything.</p><p>Soon enough, unable to keep my love object to myself, I came clean with my parents. <b class=\"now\">Fairly clean</b>, at least: I kept the hardball under wraps, nestling a tennis ball into the glove\u2019s pocket in a prissily responsible manner. I told my father I thought I better tell him I\u2019d gotten a baseball glove. It was a really good one. He massaged it with his thumbs, sort of churning them around in the glove. The leather seemed okay, he allowed, but he said he didn\u2019t see why the glove had to look the way it did. He whapped his fist in it a few times and then look it with both hands and bent it back and forth as if to reprimand it for the affectation of its deep pocket. He entered briefly into the subject, familiar to all baseball-book readers, of infielders sitting on their gloves to keep them flat so they could turn the ball over fast. I said I knew about that.</p><p>He said, \u201cIs this the best you can do for a ball?\u201d I told him that actually I had bought a baseball, but that I only used it against the side of the brick dormitory\u2014you know the wall that doesn\u2019t have any windows low down you could accidentally hit.

Then, as the red-giant phase ends, the star blows off its outer layers, giving rise to an expanding gas cloud called a planetary nebula.

But during its brief return to fusion-powered life, its interaction with the surrounding cloud of gas creates a fascinating astronomical laboratory for the study of stellar and interstellar processes.</p><p>The star FG Sagittae, a highly variable star in the constellation Sagitta, seems to be a case in point. FG Sagittae lies at the heart of a planetary nebula called He 1-5. In the past thirty years the star\u2019s temperature has dropped from more than 30,000 degrees Fahrenheit to less than 10,000 degrees, though its brightness has changed erratically from year to year. As with an old, grease-choked diesel engine struggling to start back up, the star\u2019s efforts to restart nuclear fusion create puffs of thick smoke\u2014carbon atoms coughed up from the fading stellar core. The smoke absorbs the star\u2019s radiating heat and periodically obscures the visible light it emits. To see through the haze and examine the goings-on near the star\u2019s surface, astronomers must look at its radiation in less obscured wavelengths, such as infrared light.</p><p>A research team led by Robert A. Gehrz of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis has now done just that. Recently the team published the results of twenty years of monitoring the infrared properties of FG Sagittae with three telescopes equipped with infrared photometers\u2014in effect, photon counters. One instrument is in Minnesota, one in Arizona, and one in Wyoming. Gehrz and his colleagues discovered that, though the star\u2019s overall brightness and temperature have changed dramatically through the years, carbon dust from the surface of FG Sagittae has been shining more or less steadily at a temperature of about 1,200 degrees F (650 degrees Celsius). That\u2019s roughly hot enough to melt aluminum, but substantially cooler than the core of any star undergoing active nuclear fusion. Gehrz and his colleagues conclude that, besides giving rise to clouds of obscuring gas, FG Sagittae is powering a strong stellar wind peppered with this carbon dust. They think this dust has been glowing continuously for the past decade.

As with an old, grease-choked diesel engine struggling to start back up, the star\u2019s efforts to restart nuclear fusion create puffs of thick smoke\u2014carbon atoms coughed up from the fading stellar core. The smoke absorbs the star\u2019s radiating heat and periodically obscures the visible light it emits. To see through the haze and examine the goings-on near the star\u2019s surface, astronomers must look at its radiation in less obscured wavelengths, such as infrared light.</p><p>A research team led by Robert A. Gehrz of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis has now done just that. Recently the team published the results of twenty years of monitoring the infrared properties of FG Sagittae with three telescopes equipped with infrared photometers\u2014in effect, photon counters. One instrument is in Minnesota, one in Arizona, and one in Wyoming. Gehrz and his colleagues discovered that, though the star\u2019s overall brightness and temperature have changed dramatically through the years, carbon dust from the surface of FG Sagittae has been shining more or less steadily at a temperature of about 1,200 degrees F (650 degrees Celsius). That\u2019s roughly hot enough to melt aluminum, but substantially cooler than the core of any star undergoing active nuclear fusion. Gehrz and his colleagues conclude that, besides giving rise to clouds of obscuring gas, FG Sagittae is powering a strong stellar wind peppered with this carbon dust. They think this dust has been glowing continuously for the past decade. On the basis of the measured amount of emitted infrared radiation, Gehrz\u2019s team estimates that the wind is carrying between 1.5 and 7.5 quadrillion<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"/> tons of stellar material away from FG Sagittae each second\u2014or about eight to forty Earth masses each year.</p><p>Sooner rather than later the current burst of new nuclear fusion will cease, and the dusty stellar wind will cease.

Then, as the red-giant phase ends, the star blows off its outer layers, giving rise to an expanding gas cloud called a planetary nebula. The planetary nebula, in turn, swells in size and drops in density for at most another 100,000 years, exposing the remaining stellar core at its center. That core becomes a white dwarf\u2014the most common celestial cadaver visible in the sky. The white dwarf usually radiates its leftover heat into space for billions of years, and it slowly fades to black.</p><p>Some soon-to-be white dwarfs, however, seem to heed the counsel of poet Dylan Thomas: \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night.\u201d According to the theory of stellar evolution, the temperature in the stellar core can fluctuate wildly, and sometimes spikes as high as tens of millions of degrees. For a little while at least, the core may even flicker back into stellar life as a giant star, generating new energy with new. flares of nuclear fusion.</p><p>Alas,such a giant can\u2019t last long, because the core is, in essence, running on fumes. Without a substantial fuel source to sustain fusion, a nuclear re-ignition of this kind runs out of gas within a few centuries, and the star heads back toward white dwarfhood. But during its brief return to fusion-powered life, its interaction with the surrounding cloud of gas creates a fascinating astronomical laboratory for the study of stellar and interstellar processes.</p><p>The star FG Sagittae, a highly variable star in the constellation Sagitta, seems to be a case in point. FG Sagittae lies at the heart of a planetary nebula called He 1-5. In the past thirty years the star\u2019s temperature has dropped from more than 30,000 degrees Fahrenheit to less than 10,000 degrees, though its brightness has changed erratically from year to year.
