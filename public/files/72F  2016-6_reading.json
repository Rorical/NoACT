The natural history collections crucial to the work are tossed. </span></p><p><span>Outside taxonomy, no one is much up in arms about this, but perhaps we should be, because the ordering and naming of life is no esoteric science. The past few decades have seen a stream of studies that show that sorting and naming the natural world is a universal, deep-seated and fundamental human activity, one we cannot afford to lose because it is essential to understanding the living world, and our place in it. </span></p><p><span><span>Anthropologists were the first to recognize that taxonomy might be more than the science officially founded by Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, in the 1700s. Studying how nonscientists order and name life, creating what are called folk taxonomies, anthropologists began to realize that when people across the globe were creating ordered groups and giving names to what lived around them, they followed highly stereotyped patterns, appearing unconsciously to follow a set of unwritten rules. Not that conformity to rules was at first obvious to anthropologists who were instead understandably dazzled by the variety in folk taxonomies. The Ilongots, for example, a people of the Philippines, name gorgeous wild orchids after human body parts. There bloom the thighs, there fingernails, yonder elbows and thumbs. The Rofaifo people of New Guinea classify the cassowary, a giant bird complete, with requisite feathers and beak, as a mammal. In fact, there seemed, at first glance, to be little room even for agreement among people, let alone a set of universally followed rules. </span><b class=\"now\">More recently, however, deep underlying similarities have begun to become apparent.</b> </span></p><p><span>Cecil Brown, an anthropologist who has studied folk taxonomies in 188 languages, has found that people recognize the same basic categories repeatedly, including fish, birds, snakes, mammals, \u201cwugs\u201d (meaning worms and insects), trees, vines, herbs and bushes. </span></p><p><span>Dr. Brown\u2019s finding would be considerably less interesting if these categories were clearcut depictions of reality that must inevitably be recognized. But tree and bush are hardly that, since there is no way to define a tree versus a bush. The two categories grade insensibly into one another. Wugs, likewise, are neither an evolutionarily nor ecologically nor otherwise cohesive group. Still, people repeatedly recognize and name these oddities. </span></p><p><span>Likewise, people consistently use two word epithets to designate specific organisms within a larger group of organisms, despite there being an infinitude of potentially more logical methods. It is so familiar that it is hard to notice. In English, among the oaks, we distinguish the pin oak, among bears, grizzly bears. When Mayan Indians, familiar with the wild piglike creature known as peccaries, encountered Spaniards\u2019 pigs, they dubbed them \u201cvillage peccaries.\u201d We use two part names for ourselves as well; Sally Smith or Li Wen. Even scientists are bound by this practice, insisting on Latin binomials for species. </span></p><p><span>There appears to be such a profound unconscious agreement that people will even concur on which exact words make the best names for particular organisms.

A quarter to a third of the colony scurries out looking for new possibilities. </p><p>\u201cI think of the ants as a sort of search engine,\u201d ant biologist Nigel Franks says. In one set of tests, he and his students disrupted a nest and watched to see what the ants would make of a series of new possibilities that improved with distance. The best nest was almost three meters distant, nine times as far from the original home as a nearby but less appealing choice. \u201cIt was just such fun doing this experiment because the ants won,\u201d Franks says. </p><p>In spite of the epic distances, the ants typically found and agreed to move into the best nest. \u201cThey\u2019re fantastic at it.\u201d Franks says. </p><p>Franks and Elva Robinson, both of the University of Bristol, monitored rock ants by fitting them with radio-frequency identification tags. The data suggest that each scout follows a simpler rule than previously thought, Robinson, Franks and their colleagues reported online in<span> <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>. </span></p><p>Instead of making direct comparisons between sites, a scout follows a threshold rule. If she finds a poor site, she keeps searching. When she finds a site that exceeds her \u201cgood enough\u201d threshold, she returns to the original nest. </p><p>Next, previous work shows, the scout recruits a new scout to join her on a trek to the good site. She dashes around tapping her antennae on other ants and releasing a pheromone from her sting gland, explains Stephen Pratt of Arizona State University in Tempe. Usually she finds a volunteer within a minute or so, and the two set off tandem running. </p><p>Scout A, who knows the way, runs back toward the nest while her follower, B, jogs closely enough to tap antennae against the leader. Should A sprint a little too fast and dash beyond antennae range, she slows until her partner catches up. Periodically the two ants stop, and the newbie looks around as if learning landmarks. It\u2019s a slow way to get to the site, and Franks argues that it qualifies as animal teaching. </p><p>When the ants do reach the possible site, the recruit explores it and, depending on her assessment, returns to recruit yet another scout. </p><p>As with bees, it\u2019s the quorum of scouts at the sites that matters. When enough of them gather at a particular place to encounter each other at a sufficiently high rate, they\u2019ve got a decision. </p><p>Once scouts reach that decision, their behavior changes. Each scout dashes back to the nest, but instead of coaxing a nest mate for a tour, she just grabs somebody. She uses a mouthpart hook, an over the shoulder throw, and off she goes with the passive nest mate curled on her back in an ant version of the fetal position. Carrying takes about a third as long as leading would, and scouts can haul the rest of the colony to a new home within hours. The ants shift from the independent info gathering of scouts to group implementation of the quorum\u2019s decision. </p><p>Rock ants\u2019 willingness to thrive in the lab allows experiments on finer points of collective decision making, Pratt says. For example, forcing a crisis among the ants demonstrates that they will, in a pinch, trade accuracy for speed. When researchers destroy an old nest so that ants are completely exposed, the ants scope and relocate within hours. Other experiments that just offer the ants a better nest but don\u2019t ruin their current one can result in days of deliberation. Speed has its costs, and ants in a hurry now and then make mistakes, such as splitting the colony between two nests. Slower moves prove more accurate. </p><p>The quorum system could be widespread in group behavior in nature, Pratt says. Overall it\u2019s a beautiful tool, allowing for carefully balanced independence plus some shortcut speed. Yet the system \u201chas a dark side,\u201d he acknowledges. Once individuals have made their independent assessments and then a quorum has reached agreement, fellows copy the quorum behavior. The chances are low that the whole quorum will reach the same wrong decision. But flukes can happen.
